# Changelog

All notable changes to the Enterprise Chunker system will be documented in this file.
## Version 2.1.3 - 2025-10-29 - Project Consolidation & Legacy Snapshots

### 🔄 Consolidation
- Unified older Chunker/ClaudeExportFixer iterations under `C:\_chunker`
- Migrated historical outputs to `C:\_chunker\04_output\<ProjectName>_<timestamp>`
- Collected legacy docs/config/logs/db into:
  - `99_doc\legacy\<ProjectName>_<timestamp>`
  - `06_config\legacy\<ProjectName>_<timestamp>`
  - `05_logs\legacy\<ProjectName>_<timestamp>`
  - `03_archive\legacy\<ProjectName>_<timestamp>`

### 📦 Script Backups
- Backed up project scripts with timestamp-prefix to
  `C:\Users\carucci_r\OneDrive - City of Hackensack\00_dev\backup_scripts\<ProjectName>\`
- Excludes virtualenvs, site-packages, node_modules, and .git

### 🧹 Snapshot Policy
- Keep only the latest legacy snapshot per project (older snapshots pruned)
- Now-empty old project folders archived then removed after verification

### 📁 Updated Documentation
- `README.md` updated with consolidation notes and locations
- `ENTERPRISE_CHUNKER_SUMMARY.md` updated with unified structure and snapshot policy

### 🧩 File Type Support
- Added support for `.xlsm` (Excel macro-enabled) files via openpyxl

### 🧾 Sidecar & Code Block Summaries
- Added optional JSON sidecar per processed file (enabled by default)
- For Python files, extract class/function blocks with spans and signatures
- Optional transcript appendix “Code Blocks Summary” for .py files (enabled by default)
- New config flags: `enable_json_sidecar`, `enable_block_summary`, `enable_grok`

## Version 2.1.4 - 2025-10-30 - Watcher Robustness & Write-back

### 🔍 Discovery Improvements
- Case-insensitive extension matching using `Path.iterdir()` with lowercased suffix

### 🖱️ Windows SendTo + Origin Manifests
- Added optional Windows SendTo helper (`SendTo/Chunker.ps1` + `Chunker.bat`) to copy files/folders into `02_data`
- Per-file manifest `<file>.origin.json` captures original path, times, size, SHA-256; watcher uses this to populate sidecar origin
- Optional HMAC verification with key in `06_config/manifest_hmac.key` (best-effort, non-blocking)

### ⚙️ Defaults & Config
- `celery_enabled` default set to `false` for direct processing unless explicitly enabled
