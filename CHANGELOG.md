## [Version 1.1.0] - 2025-10-27

### Added
- **Timestamp-prefixed output folders**: Output folders now include `YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS_` prefix for better chronological organization
- **Enhanced file organization**: Processed files are now organized by processing timestamp, making it easier to track when files were processed
- **Robust chunking logging**: Added detailed logging for chunking operations including text length, sentence count, chunk parameters, and processing statistics
- **Directory cleanup and organization**: Moved old scripts to archive, organized documentation in 99_doc folder

### Fixed
- **Critical Fix**: Resolved Unicode filename processing issues that prevented files with special characters (emojis, symbols) from being processed correctly
- **Enhanced filename sanitization**: Improved regex-based cleaning to handle problematic characters while preserving readable filenames
- **Unicode encoding errors**: Fixed console logging issues with special characters that caused processing failures
- **Directory creation failures**: Resolved "No such file or directory" errors when creating output folders for files with special characters
- **Windows path length limits**: Fixed directory name length issues by reducing filename limit to 50 characters to account for timestamp prefixes

### Technical Details
- Added enhanced filename sanitization using regex pattern `[^\w\s-]` to remove special characters
- Implemented safe filename logging with ASCII encoding fallback to prevent console encoding errors
- Added filename length limits (100 characters) to prevent Windows path length issues
- Improved error handling for directory creation and file writing operations

### Impact
- Files with emojis, special symbols, and Unicode characters now process successfully
- Eliminated processing failures that previously required manual filename changes
- Improved system reliability for diverse file naming conventions
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing filename formats
