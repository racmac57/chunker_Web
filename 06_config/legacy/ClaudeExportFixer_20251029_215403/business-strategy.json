Here are the key takeaways:\n\n**Critical Insights:**\n\n1. **Initial Investment**: You'll need approximately $201,000 to launch properly. This includes a crucial 3-month operating expense buffer.\n\n2. **Break-even Timeline**: You should reach profitability around month 6, which is good for the industry. The first year shows a small loss (-$1,531), which is actually quite strong for a new coffee shop.\n\n3. **Customer Growth**: The projection assumes conservative growth from 60 to 150 customers daily. With strong marketing, you could exceed this.\n\n4. **Biggest Challenges**:\n   - **Rent**: At 16.2% of revenue, Seattle's high rent is a major factor\n   - **Labor costs**: At 32.4%, this is manageable but needs careful scheduling\n   - **First 5 months**: You'll burn through about $19,000 of your reserves\n\n**Recommendations for Success:**\n\n1. **Secure Extra Funding**: Consider having $250,000 total (extra $50K buffer) for unexpected costs\n2. **Focus on Month 3-6**: This is when marketing efforts will be crucial to hit break-even\n3. **Track Daily**: Monitor customer count daily - if you're behind projection, adjust immediately\n4. **Catering Revenue**: Not included in projections but could accelerate profitability\n\nWould you like me to adjust any assumptions or create scenarios for best/worst case projections?",
