      "text": "I'd be happy to help you create a delicious vegetarian, peanut-free pad thai! I'll provide you with a recipe that uses tahini or sunflower seed butter as a peanut alternative, and tofu for protein.\n\nI've created a fully adapted pad thai recipe that's both vegetarian and peanut-free! The key substitutions are:\n\n**Main Adaptations:**\n1. **Tahini or sunflower seed butter** replaces peanut butter in the sauce - provides similar richness and nutty flavor\n2. **Roasted sunflower seeds** replace crushed peanuts for garnish - adds the important crunch element\n3. **Extra-firm tofu** provides the protein (replacing meat/shrimp)\n\n**Pro Tips for Success:**\n- Don't overcook the noodles - they should have a slight chew\n- Work quickly over high heat for authentic flavor\n- The balance of sweet, sour, salty, and spicy is key - taste and adjust!\n\nWould you like suggestions for side dishes to serve with this, or tips on prepping ingredients in advance for a quicker weeknight meal?",

            "content": "# Vegetarian Peanut-Free Pad Thai\n*Serves 4 | Prep: 20 min | Cook: 15 min*\n\n## Ingredients\n\n### Noodles & Protein\n- 8 oz (225g) flat rice noodles (medium width)\n- 14 oz (400g) extra-firm tofu, pressed and cubed\n- 3 eggs (optional - omit for vegan)\n- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n\n### Sauce\n- 3 tablespoons tahini or sunflower seed butter\n- 3 tablespoons tamarind paste\n- 3 tablespoons brown sugar\n- 2 tablespoons soy sauce\n- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar\n- 1 tablespoon lime juice\n- 1 teaspoon sriracha (adjust to taste)\n\n### Vegetables & Aromatics\n- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n- 2 shallots, thinly sliced\n- 1 cup bean sprouts\n- 3 green onions, cut into 1-inch pieces\n- 1/4 cup pickled radish (optional)\n- 1 carrot, julienned\n\n### Garnishes\n- 1/4 cup roasted sunflower seeds (peanut substitute)\n- Fresh cilantro\n- Lime wedges\n- Extra bean sprouts\n- Thai basil (if available)\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Prepare the Noodles\n1. Soak rice noodles in warm water for 30-45 minutes until soft but not mushy\n2. Drain and set aside\n3. **Pro tip**: Don't over-soak or they'll become too soft when stir-fried\n\n### Step 2: Make the Sauce\n1. Whisk together tahini, tamarind paste, brown sugar, soy sauce, rice vinegar, lime juice, and sriracha\n2. Add 2-3 tablespoons water to thin if needed\n3. Taste and adjust sweet/sour/salty balance\n\n### Step 3: Prepare the Tofu\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large wok or skillet over high heat\n2. Add tofu cubes and fry until golden on all sides (5-6 minutes)\n3. Remove and set aside\n\n### Step 4: Stir-Fry\n1. Add remaining oil to the wok\n2. Add garlic and shallots, stir-fry for 30 seconds\n3. Push to the side and add eggs (if using), scramble quickly\n4. Add drained noodles and sauce, toss for 2-3 minutes\n5. Add tofu, carrot, pickled radish\n6. Toss everything together for 2 minutes\n7. Add bean sprouts and green onions in the last minute\n8. Remove from heat\n\n### Step 5: Serve\n1. Divide among plates\n2. Top with sunflower seeds, cilantro, and fresh bean sprouts\n3. Serve with lime wedges\n\n## Chef's Notes\n\n### Peanut Alternatives\n- **Tahini**: Provides creamy, nutty flavor closest to peanut butter\n- **Sunflower seed butter**: Slightly earthier taste, great nutrition\n- **Almond butter**: Works if tree nuts are okay (thinner consistency)\n\n### Making it Vegan\n- Omit eggs entirely or substitute with crumbled firm tofu\n- Add 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast to sauce for umami\n\n### Texture Tips\n- Keep heat high for proper \"wok hei\" (breath of the wok)\n- Work quickly to prevent noodles from becoming mushy\n- Add vegetables in order of cooking time needed\n\n### Storage\n- Best enjoyed fresh\n- Leftovers keep 2-3 days refrigerated\n- Reheat with a splash of water to loosen noodles",
