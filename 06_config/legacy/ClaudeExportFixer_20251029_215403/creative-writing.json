            "content": "# The Color of Lies\n\nDetective Iris Chen sat across from Marcus Webb in Interview Room 3, her fingers absently tracing patterns on her sketchpad. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting harsh shadows across Webb's angular face.\n\n\"Tell me about Tuesday night,\" Iris said, her voice deliberately casual.\n\n\"I was home.\" The words emerged from Webb's mouth wrapped in a sickly yellow-green, like bruised fruit. The color pooled in Iris's peripheral vision, making her stomach turn slightly. A lie, but a small one.\n\n\"All evening?\"\n\nWebb shifted in his metal chair. \"Yeah, watching the game. Lakers versus Celtics.\"\n\nThis time, the lie erupted in violent orange streaks, aggressive and desperate. Iris's pencil stilled on the paper. There was no Lakers-Celtics game on Tuesday.\n\n\"Interesting game,\" she said, allowing herself a small smile. \"Who won?\"\n\n\"Lakers, overtime.\" The orange intensified, now edged with red panic. Webb was digging himself deeper.\n\nIris leaned back, studying him. Most detectives watched for tells—nervous tics, shifting eyes, sweating. She watched for colors. After twenty-three years of living with synesthesia, she'd learned to read the palette of deception like a master painter.\n\n\"Marcus,\" she said softly, \"the Lakers were in Denver on Tuesday. They lost by twelve points.\"\n\nThe orange dissolved instantly, replaced by the silvery blue of surprise. Then Webb's next words came wrapped in clear, crystalline truth: \"How did you—\"\n\n\"I pay attention,\" Iris said simply. She turned her sketchpad toward him, revealing not notes but an abstract drawing—swirls of yellow-green and orange, a visual map of his lies. \"Now, would you like to tell me where you really were? Or should I keep painting?\"\n\nWebb stared at the drawing, unnerved by something he couldn't quite understand. The truth, when it finally came, appeared to Iris in soft pearl white, clean and iridescent.\n\n\"I was at the warehouse on Pier 47,\" he whispered. \"But I swear, I didn't know about the body until later.\"\n\nPearl white. Truth.\n\nIris smiled and flipped to a fresh page in her sketchpad. Now they were getting somewhere.",
