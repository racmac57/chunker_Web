Act as a professional copywriter. Please rewrite the following text in a concise, professional tone formatted for an email response. Correct spelling and grammar errors. To be clear, 
you want me use CAD data (not RMS data) to find the top three Calls for service that occurred in Post 5&6, Post 7, Post 8 and Post 9? If this report is to be completed and submitted weekly with the Time Based SCRPA, am I only providing the previous 7-Days (Tuesday to Monday) for the placed based report? Do you want the Calls for service displayed as points on the map or a heat map or do you have something else in mind? Do you want me to include charts to the slides? If so, what would like the carts to visualize? ## Response:

Subject: Clarification Needed: CAD Data Analysis & Report Format

Hello,

I'd like to confirm a few details regarding the data analysis requirements:

1. Should I analyze CAD data (rather than RMS data) to identify the top three calls for service in Posts 5&6, 7, 8, and 9? 2. For the weekly report submission with the Time Based SCRPA, would you like the place-based analysis to cover the previous seven days (Tuesday through Monday)? 3. How would you prefer the calls for service to be visualized on the map - as point locations, heat map, or another format? 4. Would you like charts included in the presentation slides? If so, please specify which metrics or trends you'd like visualized. Looking forward to your guidance on these points. Best regards,
[Your name]
