# Chunk 7 Summary

For example:
Pull current assignment data from Assignment_Master.xlsm
Link training attendance to the correct Division / Unit / Team
Identify missing certs, duplicate enrollments, or expired recert dates
🧠 Optional Enhancement:
If you want more participation or visibility from the offices (e.g., CSB, OPS, Patrol), you could optionally:
Allow view-only access to a filtered version of the training log that only shows their officers
Or give them a simple training request form that feeds into the main tracker
But keep the main workbook centralized under Policy & Training control. ✅ Summary Recommendation
Topic	Recommendation
Separate training workbooks per office	❌ Not recommended
Maintain one central master tracker	✅ Yes — managed by Policy & Training
Link training data to assignment	✅ Use Assignment_Master.xlsm in Python
Give offices visibility (optional)	✅ Via filtered views or reports, not edit access
Automate summaries with Python → Power BI	✅ Ideal setup
Would you like a sample Python script that:
Takes your current training log
Joins it to officer assignments
Flags missing certificates or expired recert dates
Outputs a clean summary to feed Power BI? I can tag it CODE_20250626_002 and fully document it for you.
