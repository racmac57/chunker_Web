I can see the issue. Your working query is named **`ROLLING_12_MONTHS_SUMMARY (for Matrix)`** but the EXECUTIVE query is trying to reference `ROLLING_12_MONTHS_SUMMARY` (without the "(for Matrix)" part). ## 🔧 **Fix the Reference:**

Replace the entire ROLLING_12_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY code with this corrected version:

```m
let
    // Get data from rolling summary (correct name with parentheses)
    RollingData = #"ROLLING_12_MONTHS_SUMMARY (for Matrix)",
    
    // Calculate 12-month totals
    Total_Comp_Time = List.Sum(RollingData[#"Accrued Comp. Time"]),
    Total_Cash_OT = List.Sum(RollingData[#"Accrued Overtime"]),
    Total_OT_Hours = List.Sum(RollingData[#"Total OT Hours"]),
    Total_Injured_Duty = List.Sum(RollingData[#"Injured on Duty"]),
    Total_Military_Time = List.Sum(RollingData[#"Military Time"]),
    Total_SLEO_Sick = List.Sum(RollingData[#"SLEO III (Hours)"]),
    Total_PEO_Sick = List.Sum(RollingData[#"PEO Sick Hours"]),
    Total_Sick_Days = List.Sum(RollingData[#"Full-Time Employee Sick (Days)"]),
    
    // Average active officers
    Avg_Active_Officers = Number.Round(List.Average(RollingData[#"Active Officers"]), 0),
    
    // Create executive summary table
    ExecutiveSummary = #table(
        {"Metric", "Value", "Format"},
        {
            {"Accrued Comp. Time (Hours)", Total_Comp_Time, "Hours"},
            {"Accrued Overtime (Hours)", Total_Cash_OT, "Hours"},
            {"Total OT Hours (12 Months)", Total_OT_Hours, "Hours"},
            {"Injured on Duty (Hours)", Total_Injured_Duty, "Hours"},
            {"Military Time (Hours)", Total_Military_Time, "Hours"},
            {"SLEO III (Hours)", Total_SLEO_Sick, "Hours"},
            {"PEO Sick Hours", Total_PEO_Sick, "Hours"},
            {"Full-Time Employee Sick (Days)", Total_Sick_Days, "Count"},
            {"Average Active Officers", Avg_Active_Officers, "Count"}
        }
    )
in
    ExecutiveSummary
```

## 🎯 **Key Change:**
**Line 3 changed from:**
```m
RollingData = ROLLING_12_MONTHS_SUMMARY,
```
**To:**
```m
RollingData = #"ROLLING_12_MONTHS_SUMMARY (for Matrix)",
```

**The `#"..."` syntax is required when query names contain spaces and parentheses! **

This should fix the "wasn't recognized" error immediately. ## Prompt:
