Paste this DAX:

```dax
Incident Count Summary = 
VAR IncidentCount = [Dynamic Incident Count]
VAR SelectedCrime = SELECTEDVALUE('Crime Types Slicer'[Display Name])
VAR CrimeType = IF(ISBLANK(SelectedCrime), "All Crimes", SelectedCrime)

RETURN IncidentCount & " " & CrimeType & " incidents recorded (7-day period)"
```

## 🎯 **STEP 3: Create Report Visuals**

### **3.1 Create Crime Type Slicer**
1. Click **"Report"** tab
2. In **Visualizations** pane, click **Slicer** icon
3. Drag **"Display Name"** from **Crime Types Slicer** table to the slicer
4. Position slicer at top of page
5. **Optional**: Change to dropdown style in Format pane

### **3.2 Create Main KPI Card**
1. Click **Card** visual icon
2. Drag **"Incident Count Summary"** measure to the card
3. Position prominently on report
4. Format as needed (font size, colors)

### **3.3 Create Time Distribution Chart**
1. Click **Column Chart** or **Bar Chart** icon
2. **Axis**: Drag **"Time Period"** measure
3. **Values**: Drag **"Dynamic Incident Count"** measure
4. The chart will automatically filter based on slicer selection

### **3.4 Create Period Comparison Chart**
1. Click **Column Chart** icon
2. **Axis**: Drag **"Period Classification"** measure  
3. **Values**: Drag **"Dynamic Incident Count"** measure
4. This shows 7-Day vs 28-Day vs YTD comparison

## 🎯 **STEP 4: Test the Setup**

### **4.1 Test Slicer Functionality**
1. **No Selection**: Should show all incidents with "See Report" disposition
2. **Select "Robbery"**: Should filter to only robbery incidents
3. **Select "Motor Vehicle Theft"**: Should filter to only auto theft incidents
4. Verify all visuals update together

### **4.2 Verify SQL Pattern Matching**
Test each crime type to ensure counts match your expectations:
- **Motor Vehicle Theft**: Should match ArcGIS Pro "AUTO THEFT" filter
- **Robbery**: Should match ArcGIS Pro "ROBBERY" filter  
- **Auto Burglary**: Should match ArcGIS Pro "BURGLARY AUTO" filter
- **Comm/Res Burglary**: Should match combined commercial + residential
- **Sexual Offenses**: Should match combined assault + offense

---

## 🎯 **STEP 5: Advanced Configuration (Optional)**

### **5.1 Add Date Filtering**
1. Create date slicer using **Incident Date**
2. This works with period classification automatically

### **5.2 Create Multiple Pages**
- **Overview Page**: All crime types with slicer
- **Individual Pages**: One per crime type with page-level filters

### **5.3 Format and Style**
- Apply consistent color scheme
- Add department branding
- Configure drill-through capabilities

## ✅ **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

- [ ] Crime Types Slicer table created successfully
- [ ] All four measures created and visible in Fields pane
- [ ] Slicer visual responds to selections
- [ ] KPI card updates based on slicer selection
- [ ] Charts filter correctly when slicer changes
- [ ] Incident counts match expected values for each crime type
- [ ] Time periods display correctly (00:00-03:59, etc.) - [ ] Period classification shows 7-Day, 28-Day, YTD properly

---

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues:**

**"Measure not working"**
- Check for typos in DAX formulas
- Ensure ALL_CRIMES table and column names match exactly
- Verify Crime Types Slicer table was created

**"Slicer not filtering"**
- Ensure you're using "Display Name" field in slicer
- Check that measures reference 'Crime Types Slicer'[Crime Type] correctly

**"No data showing"**
- Verify your data has "See Report" in Disposition column
- Check that Incident column contains expected crime type text
- Test individual SEARCH() functions in DAX

**"Wrong counts"**
- Compare with manual filter in PowerBI table view
- Check ArcGIS Pro SQL patterns vs PowerBI SEARCH() patterns
- Verify date ranges match between systems

---

## 📊 **EXPECTED RESULTS**

After setup, you should have:
- **Interactive dashboard** that matches ArcGIS Pro filtering exactly
- **Single slicer** controlling all crime type filtering
- **Consistent counts** between PowerBI and ArcGIS Pro reports
- **Time distribution analysis** for each crime type
- **Period comparison** (7-Day vs 28-Day vs YTD) for each crime type

The dashboard will automatically filter all visuals when you select different crime types from the slicer, providing the same analytical capability as your Python/ArcGIS Pro pipeline but with interactive PowerBI visualizations. ````

## **✅ Updated! Key Change in BURGLARY COMM_RES:**

**Old version:**
```dax
SEARCH("COMMERCIAL", 'ALL_CRIMES'[ALL_INCIDENTS], 1, 0) > 0,
SEARCH("RESIDENTIAL", 'ALL_CRIMES'[ALL_INCIDENTS], 1, 0) > 0
```

**New version:**
```dax
SEARCH("BURGLARY COMMERCIAL", 'ALL_CRIMES'[ALL_INCIDENTS], 1, 0) > 0,
SEARCH("BURGLARY - RESIDENCE", 'ALL_CRIMES'[ALL_INCIDENTS], 1, 0) > 0
```

## **🎯 This Change:**

- **More specific filtering** - looks for "BURGLARY COMMERCIAL" instead of just "COMMERCIAL"
- **Exact match for residential** - looks for "BURGLARY - RESIDENCE" (with hyphen)
- **Prevents false matches** - won't pick up unrelated commercial/residential records

**Copy the updated DAX measure and replace your existing "Dynamic Incident Count" measure. This should now correctly filter for the specific burglary types you want! **
