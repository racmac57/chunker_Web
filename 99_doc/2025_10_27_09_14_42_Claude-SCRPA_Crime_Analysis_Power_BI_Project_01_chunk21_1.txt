He was last seen wearing a white T-shirt and has a tattoo on his left arm. On July 18th, 2025 at approximately 15:30 hours, the victim responded to Hackensack Police Department to report a robbery that occurred on July 17th, 2025, between 16:30 and 17:00 hours. The victim stated that the suspect entered the store and approached him, claiming he wanted to exchange a negative battery cord that he had purchased. The victim informed the suspect that a receipt was required for the exchange. The suspect became angry upon learning that he could not return the item. He then proceeded to the aisle where the item was located, and took a different sized negative battery cord, and exited the store without paying. The victim waited a few minutes before going outside to try to get a visual of the suspect's license plate. As the victim was walking out, the suspect noticed him, stopped his vehicle, and exited. The suspect verbally threatened the victim, saying, "If you come any closer, I will stab you!" The victim observed the suspect holding a black box cutter by his leg. The suspect then got back into his vehicle and drove away in an unknown direction. The victim was unable to see the suspect's license plate but reported that the suspect left in a possible 2005 Black BMW convertible without a front license plate. The estimated value of the item taken was $20.00. The victim expressed concern for his safety, fearing that the suspect might return.The Detective Bureau was notified, and Det.

I'll help you build a comprehensive data processing pipeline that addresses all your requirements. Let me search your project knowledge first to understand your current CAD/RMS cleaning scripts and then create an enhanced solution. **project_knowledge_search**

cad_date query new m code has lots of errors review cad_date_quey_Table in the project history
Edit
Searched project for “CAD_Data query Table error datetime time response spent”
6 results
Let me get your existing CAD_Data query from the project history:
Searched project for “CAD_Data TransformCAD function FileBinary Time Response Time Spent”
5 results
Based on the project history, I can see the issue. Let me create a simplified CAD_Data query that works with your existing structure without complex functions:
Simple CAD_Data Fix - No Complex Functions
Code
🔧 Simple Fix Strategy:
✅ Step 1: Replace CAD_Data Query
Use the simple CAD_Data query above
This AVOIDS trying to fix Time Response/Time Spent in M-Code
Instead, handles the time issues in DAX
✅ Step 2: Key Simplifications Made:
No complex time calculation functions
No custom data type conversions for time columns
Leaves Time Response and Time Spent in their original format
Only adds essential calculated columns (Date, Period, TimeOfDay, Block)
✅ Step 3: DAX Handles Time Issues:
The DAX measures include smart logic to:
Detect if Time Response/Time Spent is a number or datetime
Convert appropriately to minutes
Filter out invalid values (negative, too large)

Handle null/blank values safely
✅ Step 4: Test These DAX Measures First:
dax
Total_Records = COUNTROWS(CAD_RMS_Matched)
dax
7Day_Total =
CALCULATE(
COUNTROWS(CAD_RMS_Matched),
CAD_RMS_Matched[Period] = "7-Day"
)
dax
CAD_Match_Rate =
DIVIDE([Records_With_CAD], [Total_Records], 0)
✅ Step 5: If Time Measures Still Have Issues:
Skip the time measures for now and focus on:
Period analysis (7-Day, 28-Day counts)
Geographic analysis (Zone, Block)
Crime category breakdowns
Basic counts and percentages
🎯 Bottom Line:
This approach:
Simplifies the M-Code (no complex functions)
Moves time handling to DAX (more flexible)
Gets your basic dashboard working
Allows iterative improvement of time calculations
Try this simple approach first - it should eliminate the M-Code errors and get your DAX working!
