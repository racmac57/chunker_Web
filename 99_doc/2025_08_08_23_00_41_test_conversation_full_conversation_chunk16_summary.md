# Chunk 16 Summary

Auto-Process .txt Files: When it detects a new .txt file has been created (i.e., you've copied or saved a file there), it will automatically run the splitting logic on it. Organize Output: It will create a subfolder named output (if it doesn't already exist) and save all the split chunk files neatly inside it. Run Continuously: The script will keep running in the background, waiting for new files, until you manually stop it.
