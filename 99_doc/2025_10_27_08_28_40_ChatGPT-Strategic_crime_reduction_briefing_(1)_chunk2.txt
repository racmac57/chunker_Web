The victim stated her and the suspect was on their way back from 'Iron Bar' located in Morristown, NJ. The victim then stated the suspect had parked "a couple blocks" away from Charles Street in the city of Hackensack where the assault took place. The victim stated she refused multiple times to have any sexual contact with the suspect. The victim stated the suspect then disregarded then proceeded by penetrating his penis into her vagina. The victim then stated at this time she exited the vehicle and called the police. Lt. Dominguez arrived on scene to assist. The victim requested to be transported to police headquarters to speak with detectives for statements. The victim was transported in marked radio car #120. The rear seat was checked prior and after transport with negative results. P.O. Almonte and P.O. Badalyan followed. At police headquarters, the victim refused medical attention. Detective G. Lara-Nunez was notified. While attempting to gather more information, the victim was uncooperative and refused to speak with detectives. Ultimately she requested to use the bathroom, ordered herself an Uber, and left headquarters. A New Jersey Victim Notification Form was completed. A copy was explained and given to the victim. knapp_j	Complete	P.O. Juda DeOliveira 376	A4	Sgt.

P.O. Lemanowicz, P.O. Reyes, P.O. Anguizaca, Sgt. Briggs, and I responded to the listed location on a report of a disturbance. Upon our arrival, all parties were separated, and an ambulance was called due to the arrestee and victim having visible signs of injury. Hackensack University Medical Center Ambulance #1340 arrived and interpreted for the victim. The victim stated that the arrestee had punched her in the face causing pain as well as punched her right arm causing visible swelling. While assaulting her, he took her phone from her hand and broke it by bending it. The victim had visible swelling to her right cheek and right forearm. She further explained that she called Quito-Quituizaca, to help her and when he arrived to help, the arrestee immediately started attacking him and he defended himself. The arrestee was placed under arrest for assaulting the victim and was placed in handcuffs behind his back. I located 2 cell phones in his right front pocket while searching him. Sgt. Briggs spoke with the victim who advised him that the arrestee stole on her phone out of her hands. The victim was shown both phones in the arrestee's possession and she confirmed that one of the phones was hers. That cell phone was returned to her. HackensackUMC Ambulance responded and transported the victim to Hackensack Meridian Health Hospital. P.O. Anguizaca followed the ambulance to the hospital. While speaking on scene with various parties, the arrestee spontaneously uttered he was in his house and the two males on scene entered his house and assaulted him for no reason. The arrestee had visible signs of injury to his nose, right shin, and left foot. The arrestee was barefoot during the fight upon police response and it is believed he stepped on glass while fighting and cut his toe. The arrestee had an odor of alcoholic beverage and admitted to drinking 6 beers. The arrestee was then placed in the rear of radio car 108 which was searched prior to and after transport to Headquarters which was also negative for contraband. While at the hospital with P.O. Anguizaca, the victim further explained that the arrestee was drinking inside their bedroom and a verbal dispute ensued because the arrestee got mad that the victim took a taxi to work. The victim believes he is jealous and he started to assault her in the bedroom by pulling her hair, and pushed her on top of the bed. He then grabbed her hair again and began punching her in the face. The victim tried to cover her face with her forearm but he kept punching her and she believes that is how the injury occurred to her arm. The arrestee demanded she call the taxi driver to confront him and she did. The arrestee then went outside to confront the other party and while he was waiting for him, he took the victim's phone and broke it. At headquarters, Hackensack University Medical Center ambulance #1346 arrived to treat the arrestee's injuries but he refused medical attention and signed an Refusal of Medical Attention form. The ambulance left and ultimately returned due to the arrestee requesting medical attention later. The arrestee was transported to Holy Name Hospital with P.O. L. Lopez riding in the ambulance with the arrestee. The victim did not want to file for a restraining order, did not wish to speak to a DVRT and refused to make a written statement. ODARA was scored and filed. She was provided a copy of the victim notification form.The victim's cell phone is valued at $160.00.P.O. Anguizaca advised that the victim did not sustain any serious injuries or fractures.Sgt. Briggs authored complaint #0223W2025-360 against the arrestee for violations of 2C:12-1a(1), 2C:17-3a(1), 2C:15-1a(1), and 2C:13-3. The arrestee will be lodged in the Bergen County Jail upon discharge from the hospital. briggs_s	Complete	P.O.

* * *

**Key Takeaways & Recommendations**
-----------------------------------

*   **Burglary incidents** (both auto and residence) remain a primary concern, with multiple cases involving unsecured vehicles or compromised storage. Patrols should emphasize visible presence at multi-family housing, parking lots, and residential storage units. *   **Robbery activity** includes both street-based group violence and domestic violence. Increased night/early morning patrols in Zone 7 (Sussex Street) and Zone 6 (McKinley Street) are warranted. *   **Sexual offense** case highlights need for additional community outreach and support for victims, as lack of cooperation hinders investigations. *   **Data gaps** exist in suspect descriptions, vehicles, and in some victim loss estimates. Continued focus on prompt field documentation and evidence collection is recommended. *   **Suggested Patrol Focus:**
    *   Proactive patrols and checks at identified hotspots: 100 Arcadia Rd, 210 Main St, 240 First St, 10 Sussex St, 57 McKinley St, Charles St.
    *   Emphasize after-hours visibility and coordination with residential property managers for environmental crime prevention. *   Ensure thorough canvass for video/surveillance at scene. *   Liaise with Victim Advocacy for support and follow-up. * * *

fix the attached errors for both queries

## Response:
Below are the **corrected M Code scripts** for both queries. The error (`Token Literal expected`) is due to improper use of comparison (`<>`) with text fields (should be `Text.Contains` or proper `not` logic), and some parentheses/bracket issues. Both have been corrected and simplified for readability and robustness. * * *

**Notes:**

*   Remove any trailing commas or unnecessary lines after the final `in` statement. *   If your actual column names differ (e.g., `Case Number` vs `case_number`, `Incident Type_1` vs `IncidentType_1`), adjust accordingly for your dataset. **These scripts are drop-in ready and should resolve the “Token Literal expected” error. **
