### 📝 **How to Change the Filter Mode**

To change the behavior, simply edit the `config.json` file:

**Option 1: Process only files with specific patterns**
```json
"file_filter_mode": "patterns",
"file_patterns": ["_full_conversation", "_conversation", "_chat"]
```

**Option 2: Process only files with _full_conversation suffix**
```json
"file_filter_mode": "suffix"
```

**Option 3: Keep processing all files (current)**
```json
"file_filter_mode": "all"
```
