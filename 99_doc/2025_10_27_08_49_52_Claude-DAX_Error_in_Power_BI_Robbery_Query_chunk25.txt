Let's troubleshoot this step by step:

## **🔧 Quick Fixes to Try:**

### **Fix 1: Check Your Measure**
The error might be in the **"7-Day Period Summary"** measure. Let's create a simpler version first:

```dax
Simple 7-Day Count = 
VAR SelectedCrime = SELECTEDVALUE('Crime Types Slicer'[Display Name])
VAR CrimeType = IF(ISBLANK(SelectedCrime), "All Crimes", SelectedCrime)
VAR Count7Day = [Dynamic Incident Count]

RETURN
Count7Day & " " & CrimeType & " (7-Day Period)"
```

### **Fix 2: Remove the Card Visual Temporarily**
1. **Delete** the card visual that's showing the error
2. **Test** if your chart still works without it
3. **Re-add** a simple card later

### **Fix 3: Check Data Issues**
**Common causes:**
- **Date format mismatch** in the DAX measure
- **Missing relationships** between tables
- **Column name errors** in the measure

### **Fix 4: Verify Your Current Setup**
Check these in your Fields pane:
1. ✅ **"Crime Types Slicer"** table exists
2. ✅ **"Dynamic Incident Count"** measure works
3. ✅ **"Time Period Column"** exists and has data

## **🎯 Test Steps:**

### **Step 1: Test Simple Card**
1. Add new **Card** visual
2. Use **"Dynamic Incident Count"** (your working measure)
3. See if this works without error

### **Step 2: If Step 1 Works**
1. Try the **"Simple 7-Day Count"** measure above
2. This avoids the complex date filtering that might be causing issues

### **Step 3: Check Your Chart**
Your chart shows good data, so the core measures work. The error is likely just with the new 7-Day Period Summary measure. **Try the Simple 7-Day Count measure first - that should work without the date filtering complexity that might be causing the error. **

**Which step should we try first? **

Perfect! Since Step 1 worked, the issue is with the complex "7-Day Period Summary" measure. Let's fix it step by step. ## **🔧 Step 2: Try the Simple Version**

Create this simpler measure:

```dax
Simple 7-Day Count = 
VAR SelectedCrime = SELECTEDVALUE('Crime Types Slicer'[Display Name])
VAR CrimeType = IF(ISBLANK(SelectedCrime), "All Crimes", SelectedCrime)
VAR Count7Day = [Dynamic Incident Count]

RETURN
Count7Day & " " & CrimeType & " (7-Day Period)"
```

**Test this in a new card visual. **

## **🎯 If Step 2 Works, Then Add Date Range:**

```dax
7-Day Count with Dates = 
VAR SelectedCrime = SELECTEDVALUE('Crime Types Slicer'[Display Name])
VAR CrimeType = IF(ISBLANK(SelectedCrime), "All Crimes", SelectedCrime)
VAR Count7Day = [Dynamic Incident Count]

RETURN
IF(
    Count7Day = 0,
    "0 " & CrimeType & " during 7-Day Period (07/01/25-07/07/25)",
    Count7Day & " " & CrimeType & " during 7-Day Period (07/01/25-07/07/25)"
)
```

## **🔍 Why the Original Failed:**

The complex measure likely failed because:
1. **Date filtering conflicts** with existing filters
2. **Column name issues** (`'ALL_CRIMES'[IncidentDate]` might be wrong)
3. **Multiple CALCULATE statements** causing conflicts

## **✅ Expected Results:**

**Simple 7-Day Count:**
- "15 Sexual Offenses (7-Day Period)"
- "0 Robbery (7-Day Period)"

**With Dates:**
- "15 Sexual Offenses during 7-Day Period (07/01/25-07/07/25)"
- "0 Robbery during 7-Day Period (07/01/25-07/07/25)"

**Try the Simple 7-Day Count first and let me know if it works! **

Excellent! 🎉 Now you have a working dynamic card that shows:

- **When incidents exist**: "15 Sexual Offenses during 7-Day Period (07/01/25-07/07/25)"
- **When no incidents**: "0 Robbery during 7-Day Period (07/01/25-07/07/25)"

## **🎯 Your Dashboard Setup is Now Complete:**

✅ **Crime Type Slicer** - Controls all visuals  
✅ **Dynamic Chart Title** - Updates based on selection  
✅ **Time Distribution Chart** - Shows incidents by time periods  
✅ **7-Day Period Summary Card** - Shows count with date range  
✅ **Proper time ordering** - Chronological display  

## **🔧 Future Updates:**

**To change the date range for different weeks, just update this line:**
```dax
// Change these dates for new reporting periods
"during 7-Day Period (07/08/25-07/14/25)"  // Next week
"during 7-Day Period (07/15/25-07/21/25)"  // Week after
```

## **💡 Optional Enhancements:**

**1. Add Period Comparison Card:**
```dax
Period Comparison = 
VAR SelectedCrime = SELECTEDVALUE('Crime Types Slicer'[Display Name])
VAR CrimeType = IF(ISBLANK(SelectedCrime), "All Crimes", SelectedCrime)
RETURN CrimeType & " Comparison: 7-Day vs 28-Day vs YTD"
```

**2. Add Total Incidents Card:**
```dax
Total All Periods = 
VAR SelectedCrime = SELECTEDVALUE('Crime Types Slicer'[Display Name])
VAR CrimeType = IF(ISBLANK(SelectedCrime), "All Crimes", SelectedCrime)
VAR Total = [Dynamic Incident Count]
RETURN "Total " & CrimeType & ": " & Total
```

**Your PowerBI dashboard now matches the functionality of your ArcGIS Pro charts with dynamic filtering and proper date-based analysis! 🚀**
