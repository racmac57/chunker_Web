I can see you have 6 Excel files from May 2024 to May 2025. Let me open one of these files manually to see the structure, then fix the query. **Can you do this quick check:**

1. **Double-click** on `2025_05_Officer_Charge_Date_Case_Type.xlsx` to open it in Excel
2. **Tell me:**
   - How many sheets/tabs are in the workbook? - What are the sheet names? - What's in the first row of the main sheet? (Column headers?) - How many rows of actual data? **Meanwhile, let me create a SUPER SIMPLE test query** that just opens one file:

**Simple Single File Test**

````powerquery
// 2025-06-14-19-36-17 (EST)
// Police_Analytics/Simple_Single_File_Test
// Author: R. A. Carucci
// Purpose: Test just one InfoCop file to see the structure

let
    // Test with just the May 2025 file
    Source = Excel.Workbook(File.Contents("C:\Users\carucci_r\OneDrive - City of Hackensack\_MONTHLY_DATA\_EXPORTS\Summons\INFOCOP\Officer_Charge_Date_Case_Type\2025_05_Officer_Charge_Date_Case_Type.xlsx"), null, true)
in
    Source
````

**🎯 TRY THIS SIMPLE TEST FIRST:**

1. **Create a blank query**
2. **Paste the simple test code** above
3. **See what it shows** - this will reveal the exact structure of your Excel files

**This simple query will show:**
- All sheet names in the workbook
- Which sheets have data
- The structure of each sheet

**Once we see that, I can fix the main query to work with your specific file format! **

The issue is likely that the InfoCop exports have a different sheet structure than what the query expects. This simple test will show us exactly what we're working with. Let me know what you see from:
1. Opening the Excel file manually
2. Running the simple test query
