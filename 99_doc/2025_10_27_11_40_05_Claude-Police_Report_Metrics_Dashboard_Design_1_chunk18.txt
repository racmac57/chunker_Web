** I can see the query is working - it found and processed the files (you can see "SuccessfulFiles" in the Applied Steps), but it's hitting the condition check at the end. Looking at the formula bar: `if Table.RowCount(SuccessfulFiles) > 0 then` - this means it found files but something in the processing failed. ## **🔍 LET'S DEBUG STEP BY STEP:**

**1. Check the SuccessfulFiles step:**
- Click on **"SuccessfulFiles"** in the Applied Steps
- This will show you which files were processed successfully
- If it shows 0 rows, then all files failed processing

**2. Check the TransformFiles step:**
- Click on **"TransformFiles"** in Applied Steps  
- Look at the "Data" column - do you see "null" values or actual table data? ## **🔧 QUICK DEBUG VERSION:**

Let me create a **simple debug query** to see exactly what's in your Excel files:

// Police_Analytics/Debug_InfoCop_Files
// Author: R. A. Carucci
// Purpose: Simple debug query to see exactly what's in your Excel files

let
    Source = Folder.Files("C:\Users\carucci_r\OneDrive - City of Hackensack\_MONTHLY_DATA\_EXPORTS\Summons\INFOCOP\Officer_Charge_Date_Case_Type"),
    
    // Filter to just one file for testing
    FilteredFiles = Table.SelectRows(Source, each Text.EndsWith([Name], ".xlsx")),
    FirstFile = Table.FirstN(FilteredFiles, 1),
    
    // Look inside the first Excel file
    AddFileContents = Table.AddColumn(FirstFile, "ExcelContents", each
        let
            ExcelFile = Excel.Workbook([Content], null, true)
        in
            ExcelFile
    ),
    
    // Expand to see all sheets
    ExpandedSheets = Table.ExpandTableColumn(AddFileContents, "ExcelContents", 
        {"Name", "Data", "Kind"}, {"SheetName", "SheetData", "SheetKind"}),
    
    // Show sheet info
    SheetInfo = Table.AddColumn(ExpandedSheets, "RowCount", each 
        if [SheetData] <> null then Table.RowCount([SheetData]) else 0),
    
    // Show first few rows of each sheet
    AddPreview = Table.AddColumn(SheetInfo, "Preview", each
        if [SheetData] <> null and Table.RowCount([SheetData]) > 0 then
            Table.FirstN([SheetData], 3)
        else
            null
    ),
    
    // Select relevant columns
    FinalView = Table.SelectColumns(AddPreview, {"Name", "SheetName", "SheetKind", "RowCount", "Preview"})
in
    FinalView

## **🎯 DEBUGGING STEPS:**

**1. Create the debug query above**
- This will show you exactly what sheets exist in your Excel files
- And what the first few rows look like in each sheet

**2. Look at the results:**
- How many sheets are in each file? - What are the sheet names? - Which sheets have data (RowCount > 0)? - What does the Preview column show for the first few rows? **3. Based on what we find, I can adjust the main query**

## **⚡ QUICK TEST - TRY THIS:**

**Option A: Run the debug query first**
- Create a new blank query
- Paste the debug code
- See what it shows

**Option B: Check your current query steps**
- Click "SuccessfulFiles" step - how many rows? - Click "TransformFiles" step - are there "null" values in the Data column? **The files are there and the query is running, we just need to see what's inside the Excel files to adjust the processing logic! **

What do you see when you click on the "SuccessfulFiles" step? ## Prompt:
