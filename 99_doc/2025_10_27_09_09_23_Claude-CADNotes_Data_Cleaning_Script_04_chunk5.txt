* Test performance on desktop before publishing to Power BI Service. * If you need dynamic drill‑through on map, use the ArcGIS visual; static images don’t support filtering. Below is a clear, step‑by‑‑step plan for extracting **every** M‑query and DAX measure verbatim from your `.pbix`, fixing any DAX errors, advising on where calculations belong, and even supplying a handful of additional DAX measures (with descriptions) plus guidance on how to wire them up in visuals. ---

## 1. Export all M‑Queries via Tabular Editor

1. **Install Tabular Editor** (if you don’t already have it):
   • Download from [https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor/releases](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor/releases)
2. **Open your report** in Power BI Desktop. 3. **Launch Tabular Editor**:

   * On the External Tools ribbon, click **Tabular Editor**. 4. **Export your queries**:

   * In Tabular Editor go to **File → Export → All Queries**. * Save as e.g. `All_M_Queries.m`. 5. **Paste** the contents of that `.m` file here so I can review every step in your Power Query transformations. ---

## 2. Export all DAX Measures via DAX Studio

1. **Install DAX Studio**:
   • Download from [https://daxstudio.org/](https://daxstudio.org/)
2. **Open your report** in Power BI Desktop. 3. **Launch DAX Studio** from the External Tools ribbon. 4. **Export Measures**:

   * In the Metadata pane, right‑click **Measures** → **Export Measures** → Save as `All_Measures.dax`. 5. **Paste** the contents of that `.dax` file here so I can fix any syntax issues and optimize them. ---

## 3. I’ll then…

* **Embed** each M‑query and DAX formula verbatim in my review. * **Correct** any DAX errors (e.g. missing commas, undefined columns/measures, incorrect SWITCH/VAR usage). * **Advise** if a given calculation belongs in M (Power Query) vs. DAX (model) based on best practices:

  * **Power Query**: row‑level cleaning, type conversions, unpivot/pivot, merges. * **DAX**: dynamic aggregations, time‑intelligence, user‑driven slicers and filters. * **Refactor** any calculations that would run more efficiently in the other layer. ---

## 4. Sample “Fix” for Common DAX Errors

*(Once I see your real measures, I’ll apply these patterns where needed. )*

`​`​`sql
TrendIndicator =
VAR Current = [7DayTotal]
VAR Previous = [28DayTotal]
RETURN
  SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    Current > Previous * 1.1, "🔴 Increasing",
    Current < Previous * 0.9, "🟢 Decreasing",
    "🟡 Stable"
  )
`​`​`

`​`​`sql
TrendDescription =
VAR Total7Day   = [7DayTotal]
VAR ChangePct   = DIVIDE([7DayTotal] - [28DayTotal], [28DayTotal], 0)
VAR ChangeText  = FORMAT([7DayTotal] - [28DayTotal], "+0;-0;0")
VAR Hotspot     = [TopBlockHotspot]
VAR Trend       = [TrendIndicator]
RETURN
  "7‑Day Total: " & Total7Day 
    & " (" & FORMAT(ChangePct, "0.0%") & ") • Hotspot: " 
    & Hotspot & " • Trend: " & Trend

Find your ALL_CRIMES table (should show your Crime_Category column now)
Step 2: Create the Time Period DAX Measure
Right-click on ALL_CRIMES table in the Fields panel
Select "New measure"
Type this DAX formula in the formula bar:
DAX
Time Period =
VAR HourValue = HOUR('ALL_CRIMES'[Incident Time])
RETURN
SWITCH(
TRUE(),
HourValue >= 0 && HourValue <= 3, "00:00-03:59 Early Morning",
HourValue >= 4 && HourValue <= 7, "04:00-07:59 Morning",
HourValue >= 8 && HourValue <= 11, "08:00-11:59 Midday",
HourValue >= 12 && HourValue <= 15, "12:00-15:59 Afternoon",
HourValue >= 16 && HourValue <= 19, "16:00-19:59 Evening",
HourValue >= 20 && HourValue <= 23, "20:00-23:59 Night",
"Unknown"
)
Press Enter to save the measure
You should see "Time Period" appear under ALL_CRIMES with a calculator icon (📊)
Step 3: Create the Period Classification DAX Measure
Right-click on ALL_CRIMES table again
Select "New measure"
Type this DAX formula:
DAX
Period Classification =
VAR IncidentDate = 'ALL_CRIMES'[Incident Date]
VAR Today = TODAY()
VAR DaysFromToday = DATEDIFF(IncidentDate, Today, DAY)
VAR StartOfYear = DATE(YEAR(Today), 1, 1)
RETURN
SWITCH(
TRUE(),
IncidentDate >= Today - 6, "7-Day",
IncidentDate >= Today - 27, "28-Day",
IncidentDate >= StartOfYear, "YTD",
"Historical"
)
Press Enter to save
You should see "Period Classification" appear under ALL_CRIMES
Step 4: Test the Measures
Go to Report view (report icon on left sidebar)
Add a Table visual:
Drag Crime_Category to Values
Drag Time Period to Values
Drag Period Classification to Values
You should see data showing the time periods and classifications
Step 5: Create Your First Chart
Add a Clustered Column Chart
Configure the chart:
X-Axis: Drag Time Period here
Y-Axis: Drag Case Number here (or any ID field for count)
Legend: Drag Period Classification here
Filters: Drag Crime_Category to Filters pane
Filter to one crime type:
Click the Crime_Category filter
Check only "Motor Vehicle Theft" (or whichever you want to test)
Click Apply filter
Step 6: Format the Chart to Match Your Style
Select the chart and go to Format pane (paint roller icon)

the table view? Edit
Perfect! I can see your 7Day_28Day_250414 table with all the cycle data. This is exactly what we need to make the DAX measures work properly with your Excel-based date periods. 🔧 UPDATED DAX FOR YOUR EXCEL CYCLES
Since you're using Excel-defined periods (not just calendar calculations), let's update the DAX to use your actual cycle data:
Step 1: Updated Period Classification DAX
Replace the Period Classification measure with this version that uses your Excel cycles:
DAX
Period Classification =
VAR IncidentDate = 'ALL_CRIMES'[Incident Date]
VAR CurrentCycle =
CALCULATE(
SELECTEDVALUE('_7Day_28Day_250414_'[Report_Name]),
FILTER(
'_7Day_28Day_250414_',
IncidentDate >= '_7Day_28Day_250414_'[7_Day_Start] &&
IncidentDate <= '_7Day_28Day_250414_'[7_Day_End]
)
)
RETURN
SWITCH(
TRUE(),
// Check if incident falls in current 7-day cycle
NOT ISBLANK(CurrentCycle), "7-Day",
// Check if incident falls in current 28-day period
IncidentDate >=
CALCULATE(
MIN('_7Day_28Day_250414_'[28_Day_Start]),
'_7Day_28Day_250414_'[Is_Due] = TRUE
) &&
IncidentDate <=
CALCULATE(
MAX('_7Day_28Day_250414_'[28_Day_End]),
'_7Day_28Day_250414_'[Is_Due] = TRUE
), "28-Day",
// Year-to-date calculation
IncidentDate >= DATE(YEAR(TODAY()), 1, 1), "YTD",
// Everything else
"Historical"
)
Step 2: Keep the Time Period DAX the Same
The Time Period measure should work fine as-is:
DAX
Time Period =
VAR HourValue = HOUR('ALL_CRIMES'[Incident Time])
RETURN
SWITCH(
TRUE(),
HourValue >= 0 && HourValue <= 3, "00:00-03:59 Early Morning",
HourValue >= 4 && HourValue <= 7, "04:00-07:59 Morning",
HourValue >= 8 && HourValue <= 11, "08:00-11:59 Midday",
HourValue >= 12 && HourValue <= 15, "12:00-15:59 Afternoon",
HourValue >= 16 && HourValue <= 19, "16:00-19:59 Evening",
HourValue >= 20 && HourValue <= 23, "20:00-23:59 Night",
"Unknown"
)
Step 3: Create Relationship (If Needed)
You might need to create a relationship between the tables:
Go to Model view (cube icon on left sidebar)
Check if there's a line connecting ALL_CRIMES and 7Day_28Day_250414
If not, drag from ALL_CRIMES[Incident Date] to 7Day_28Day_250414[7_Day_Start] (or similar date field)
🎯 ALTERNATIVE SIMPLER APPROACH
If the above DAX is too complex, here's a simpler version:
Simple Period Classification:
DAX
Simple Period Classification =
VAR IncidentDate = 'ALL_CRIMES'[Incident Date]
VAR Today = TODAY()
RETURN
SWITCH(
TRUE(),
IncidentDate >= Today - 6, "7-Day",
IncidentDate >= Today - 27, "28-Day",
IncidentDate >= DATE(YEAR(Today), 1, 1), "YTD",
"Historical"
)
📊 TEST YOUR SETUP
Create a simple table visual with:
Incident Date (from ALL_CRIMES)
Time Period (your new measure)
Period Classification (your new measure)
Crime_Category (from ALL_CRIMES)
Filter to recent dates to see if the periods are showing correctly
Check that you see:
Time periods like "08:00-11:59 Midday"
Period classifications like "7-Day", "28-Day", "YTD"
❓ QUESTIONS FOR YOU
Do you see both measures (Time Period and Period Classification) in your Fields panel? ````

## 🚀 **Bulk Import Process Using DAX Studio**

### **Step 1: Prepare DAX File**
1. **Copy all measures above** into a text file
2. **Save as**: `SCRPA_Dashboard_Measures.txt`
3. **Each measure should be on separate lines** with proper DAX syntax

### **Step 2: Import via DAX Studio**
1. **Open Power BI Desktop** with your file
2. **Launch DAX Studio** from External Tools ribbon
3. **Go to Advanced tab** → **Import Measures**
4. **Select your .txt file** → **Import All**
5. **Verify measures appear** in your model

### **Step 3: Alternative Manual Import**
If bulk import has issues:
1. **Copy one measure at a time**
2. **Right-click CAD_RMS_Matched table** → **New Measure**
3. **Paste DAX code** → **Press Enter**
4. **Repeat for all measures**

## 📊 **Dashboard Page Setup Process**

### **Step 1: Create Base Page Template**
1. **Add page-level filters** for Period = "7-Day"
2. **Create standard visual layout:**
   - **Header**: Crime title, report period
   - **KPI Cards**: Current count, trend, hotspot
   - **Map**: ArcGIS or standard map with crime locations  
   - **Time Analysis**: Incidents by time of day
   - **Geographic**: Top blocks/zones table
   - **Trend**: Week-over-week comparison

### **Step 2: Configure Each Crime Page**
1. **Duplicate base template** for each crime type
2. **Add crime-specific page filter**:
   - Motor Vehicle Theft: `Crime_Category = "Motor Vehicle Theft"`
   - Burglary Auto: `Crime_Category = "Burglary - Auto"`
   - Burglary Combined: `Crime_Category IN {"Burglary - Commercial", "Burglary - Residence"}`
   - Robbery: `Crime_Category = "Robbery"`
   - Sexual Offenses: Use custom filter on IncidentType containing "SEXUAL"

### **Step 3: PDF Export Optimization**
1. **Set page size** to Letter (8.5" x 11") or A4
2. **Use high contrast colors** for print clarity
3. **Test export quality** with sample pages
4. **Ensure all text is readable** at PDF resolution

## 🎯 **Visual Configuration Guidelines**

### **Map Visual (Primary Focus)**
- **Data Field**: Enhanced_Block or lat/long if available
- **Size**: Count of incidents
- **Color**: Crime_Category or TimeOfDay
- **Filter**: Period = "7-Day" + crime type
- **Tooltip**: Case Number, Incident_Date, Officer

### **KPI Cards**
- **Current Count**: Use crime-specific count measures
- **Trend Indicator**: Week-over-week change with icons
- **Top Hotspot**: Most active block with count
- **Response Time**: Average response for CAD-matched incidents

### **Time Analysis Chart**
- **X-Axis**: TimeOfDay (with proper sort order)
- **Y-Axis**: Count of incidents
- **Drill-down**: Date hierarchy for trend analysis

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips for PDF Export**

### **Layout Optimization:**
- **Fixed visual sizes** - avoid auto-sizing for consistent PDF output
- **High DPI settings** - Use 300 DPI for crisp print quality  
- **Minimal white space** - Maximize data density for executive briefings
- **Clear legends** - Ensure all colors/symbols are explained

### **Performance Optimization:**
- **Page-level filters** instead of visual-level filters
- **Aggregated measures** rather than row-level calculations
- **Limit map data points** to avoid rendering issues
- **Test export speed** with full dataset
