Circular Dependencies:** Queries referencing each other incorrectly

## **📥 HOW TO IMPORT QUERIES (2 METHODS):**

### **METHOD 1: BLANK QUERY + ADVANCED EDITOR (RECOMMENDED)**
```
1. Power BI → Get Data → Blank Query
2. View → Advanced Editor
3. Delete all existing code
4. Paste the M code from artifact
5. Click "Done"
6. Rename query to proper name
```

### **METHOD 2: PASTE AS NEW QUERY**
```
1. Power BI → Home → Queries → New Source → Blank Query
2. Advanced Editor → Paste code → Done
3. Rename in Queries pane
```

## **🎯 CORRECT IMPORT ORDER:**

**Step 1: Import these 3 FIRST (in this order):**
1. `INFOCOP_OFFICER_CHARGE_TYPE`
2. `SUMMONS_ASSIGNED_SHIFT` 
3. `Title39_Data`

**Step 2: Then import this one:**
4. `INFOCOP_INTEGRATED_SUMMONS` (the fixed version)

**Step 3: Skip these for now:**
- `INFOCOP_OFFICER_STREET` (causes the joins to fail)
- `INFOCOP_OFFICER_STATUTE` (causes the joins to fail)

## **🔧 SIMPLIFIED APPROACH:**

**Start with just the charge type data + assignments. ** Once that's working, we can add street and statute data later. **Try this:**
1. Import `INFOCOP_OFFICER_CHARGE_TYPE` first
2. Check if it loads data successfully
3. Import `SUMMONS_ASSIGNED_SHIFT` second
4. Import the **fixed** `INFOCOP_INTEGRATED_SUMMONS`

**The fixed version is much simpler and should work immediately! **
