**Summary:**

Many of the New Jersey Statutes listed were generally accounted for in my initial descriptions of Title 39, although I didn't provide the specific details for each. The Hackensack City Ordinance numbers mostly fall under the likely scope of Chapters 127 and 170 as previously described, dealing with parking and general traffic regulations. However, ordinances 88-6D(2) and 117-3(B) likely belong to different chapters of the Hackensack City Code. Ordinance 19:9-1.17 is a State statute related to elections, not traffic or vehicles. To get the exact wording and details for the Hackensack ordinances, you will need to consult the official City of Hackensack resources. ## Prompt:
