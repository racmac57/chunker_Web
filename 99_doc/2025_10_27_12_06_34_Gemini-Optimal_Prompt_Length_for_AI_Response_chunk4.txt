*   **Learn Basic Formats:** Familiarize yourself with **JSON** (for apps/code), **XML**, and **CSV** (for spreadsheets). *   **Be Specific:** Instead of asking for "a report," ask it to **"generate a CSV with month, revenue, and profit headings. "** This makes the output immediately usable. * * *

### 7\. Iterate and Test Your Prompts with Data 📊

A prompt that works perfectly once might have been a lucky result. For reliable performance, you must test it rigorously. *   **Monte Carlo Testing:** Run the same prompt multiple times (e.g., 10-20 times) and log the outputs in a spreadsheet. *   **Measure Success:** Grade each output as "good enough" or not to get a statistical success rate (e.g., 18/20 = 90% accurate). *   **Compare Prompts:** Use this data-driven method to scientifically prove which version of a prompt is better, rather than relying on a gut feeling. * * *

### 8\. Use Unambiguous and Non-Conflicting Language 🎯

AI is creative, so vague or contradictory language will produce inconsistent results. *   **Be Unambiguous:** Instead of "produce a report," specify "list our five most popular products and write a one-paragraph description for each." *   **Avoid Conflicts:** Don't use contradictory terms like **"detailed summary. "** A summary is inherently not detailed. Such phrases confuse the model and add useless tokens. *   **Use "Spartan" Tone of Voice:** A quick hack mentioned is to simply ask for a **"Spartan tone of voice"** to get direct, pragmatic, and efficient responses. * * *

### 9\. Choose the Right Model for the Task 🧠

Don't default to the cheapest, simplest models. *   **Start Smart:** Always begin with the most capable model available (e.g., GPT-4o). The cost is often marginal for most use cases, and it will solve problems and understand nuances that simpler models can't, saving you significant time in prompt engineering. *   **Cost vs. Quality:** The return on investment for using a slightly more expensive but smarter model is almost always worth it, as the cost per run is typically fractions of a cent. ---
