# Chunk 12 Summary

Here's a quick analysis to ensure clarity and suggest optimizations if needed:

✅ Valid and Functional Keys
Key	Purpose	Status
"chunk_size": 100	Max sentences per chunk	✅
"debounce_seconds": 2	Delay to confirm file stability	✅ (Used in wait_for_file_stability)
"output_dir": "output"	Where chunk files go	✅
"archive_dir": "processed"	Where originals go after processing	✅
"watch_folder"	Source folder for files	✅
"cloud_repo_root"	Cloud sync destination	✅
"log_file"	Logging location	✅
"polling_interval": 5	Watcher scan interval (sec)	✅
"max_chunk_size_mb": 10	Not enforced in code yet, but good placeholder	⚠️ Not enforced
"min_file_size_bytes": 100	Used to skip very small files	✅
"file_stability_timeout": 30	Max seconds to wait before considering file unstable	✅
"cloud_sync_retries": 3	Retry attempts for cloud copy	✅
"log_rotation_size_mb": 5	Rotate watcher.log after 5MB	✅
"log_retention_days": 30	For cleaning old logs	✅
"enable_notifications": true	Placeholder – not used in current code	⚠️ Not implemented
"enable_cleanup": true	Used for log cleanup	✅
"merged_transcript"	Not directly referenced, likely for future merge logic	⚠️ Unused
"summary_filename"	Also unused, but possibly for summarizer	⚠️ Unused
"supported_extensions"	Could be helpful for broader processing, but not referenced	⚠️ Unused
💡 Suggestions
Unused but Valuable Keys (if planned for future):

"summary_filename" – add logic for summary generation? "merged_transcript" – implement transcript merging? "enable_notifications" – consider integrating with win10toast or similar for local alerts.
