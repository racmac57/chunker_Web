This is a test conversation for the chunker system. We need multiple sentences to ensure proper chunking behavior. The enhanced script should process this content and create meaningful chunks. This sentence adds more content for robust testing purposes. Each sentence should be properly tokenized and grouped into logical chunks. The system should handle file stability, content validation, and cloud synchronization. Finally, this last sentence completes our comprehensive test conversation file.

Here is some code that should be detected and indexed:

```python
def test_function():
    print("This is a test function")
    return True
```

And here is some more conversation content to ensure we have enough sentences for proper chunking. The system should create multiple chunks from this content. Each chunk should contain a reasonable number of sentences and be properly formatted. The metadata should include information about code blocks and other relevant details.

```javascript
// This is a JavaScript code block
function processData(data) {
    return data.map(item => item.toUpperCase());
}
```

More conversation content to fill out the chunks. The system should handle various types of content including plain text, code blocks, and structured data. This helps ensure that the chunking process works correctly for different types of AI conversation logs.

The enhanced system should now create proper metadata files, generate summaries, and build comprehensive indexes. This represents a significant improvement over the basic chunking functionality.
