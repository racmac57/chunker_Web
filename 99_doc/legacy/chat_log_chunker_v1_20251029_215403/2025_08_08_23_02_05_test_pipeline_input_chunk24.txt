You're close! Based on your transcript, it looks like you tried to run your Python source code directly in the Windows Command Prompt, which doesn't work — it expects commands, not Python code. ✅ Here's What To Do Next
Now that your script is fully ready and saved (confirmed in canvas), here’s how to make it invisible using pyinstaller:

🧱 Step-by-Step to Build Invisible .exe
Open CMD (search: Command Prompt)
Then navigate to your chunker folder:

cd C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker
Install pyinstaller (if not already):

pip install pyinstaller
Run this to build hidden .exe:

pyinstaller watcher_splitter.py --noconfirm --onefile --noconsole --name chunker_hidden
--noconsole: Hides the window. --onefile: Packages all into a single .exe. --name chunker_hidden: Outputs chunker_hidden.exe. Your .exe will be saved at:

C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist\chunker_hidden.exe
🟢 Final Check
Double-click chunker_hidden.exe. It will:

Not show a window (silent). Begin watching the watch_folder for new .txt or .md files. Do all the processing in the background. Would you like me to:
a. Provide a .bat launcher or Task Scheduler .xml for autostart at login? b. Add an optional visible mode (--debug flag) for manual launch when needed? You said:
