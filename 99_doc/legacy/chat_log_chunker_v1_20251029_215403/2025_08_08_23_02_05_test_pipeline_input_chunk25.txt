I edited the task scheduler as you instructed. I restarted the computer. Upon restarting, I see that the file that I put in prior to restarting was processed and is in the output folder. I see that a folder was created in the OneDrive cleaned folder. However, I still see the folder that was dragged in in the CHUNKER folder. I also do not see a processed folder on my C drive. And the CHUNKER command window is visible and open. Additionally, the files in the output folder were not moved to the process folder, obviously, since I don't see the process folder. ChatGPT said:
Thanks — based on everything you’ve shared, here's what happened and what you should do next to complete your setup:

✅ What Worked:
✔ Your script ran at startup via Task Scheduler. ✔ The .txt file was detected and processed. ✔ Chunked outputs were created in the output/ folder. ✔ A folder was correctly created in the OneDrive Cleaned/ directory. ❌ What's Still Broken (and Why):
Processed folder not created:

🔍 The processed_folder path is hardcoded in config but does not exist on disk. Since your script checks if the cloud copy succeeded before moving files to the processed folder, it aborted the move step when even one file failed to copy. Original file not moved from chunker/:

Same issue — cloud verification failed, so the move/delete step was skipped. Window still visible:

You successfully compiled with --noconsole, but Task Scheduler may be launching the wrong version (e.g., .py instead of .exe), or not minimized/hidden. ✅ Fix Steps:
✅ A. Ensure processed/ Folder Exists
Create this missing folder manually or update the script to auto-create it:

Path(config["processed_folder"]).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
☑ Already in your script — so this should happen unless an exception blocks it before this step. ✅ B. Ensure File Copies Succeed
Sometimes OneDrive files sync slowly. Increase cloud_retry_delay or check full_convo_path, summary_md, summary_json are actually present before copy step. ✅ C. Use the Hidden .exe at Startup
Make sure Task Scheduler points to:

C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist\chunker_hidden.exe
And NOT:

python watcher_splitter.py
Also set the task to:

✔ “Run with highest privileges”

✔ Set Start in to C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist

✔ Hidden or Minimized window setting

🛠 Suggested Next Fixes
a. Add a logger.info("All cloud files verified, proceeding to move.") before move block to confirm execution path. b. Add a final fallback to always move to processed/ even if cloud fails (optional). Let me know if you'd like me to help:

update the script to better handle OneDrive delays

automatically create and clean the processed folder on startup

show how to fully hide the window via Task Scheduler setup

Would you like that? a. Add logging and fallback move even if cloud copy fails
b. Verify Task Scheduler .exe path, clean old entries, test full reboot again

Thanks for the detailed screenshots. Here's a clear diagnosis and what you need to fix:

✅ What’s working:
Folder watcher is running. Output and Cloud directories are correctly populated. Script runs and processes .txt files. Task Scheduler launches the script on reboot. ❌ What’s not working:
Processed folder was not created → causes files to remain in chunker directory. Chunker Watcher task failed to run (0x80070002) → "File not found". Console window still visible. Manual command failed due to Path not being defined. 🔧 Fixes
✅ 1. Fix the “Processed” folder creation
You must manually create the missing folder or let Python create it. Use this in PowerShell or Python REPL:

from pathlib import Path
Path("C:/Users/carucci_r/Documents/chunker/processed").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
✅ 2. Fix Task Scheduler’s “File Not Found” Error
The most likely reason is that your scheduled task points to a deleted/moved .exe. Fix:

In Task Scheduler → right-click Chunker Watcher → Properties

Go to Actions tab → Click Edit

Make sure this path is correct:

C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist\chunker_hidden.exe
If unsure, browse to that .exe and select it again. Apply and save. ✅ 3. Hide Console Window (working already!) Your compiled binary is using --noconsole — this is correct. The visible console you’re seeing might be:

From a manual launch

From a broken Task Scheduler entry that launches the .py instead of the .exe

Once Task Scheduler is fixed to point to the .exe, you will no longer see a console. ✅ 4. Fix Python REPL Path Error
In your manual command, you got:

NameError: name 'Path' is not defined
You forgot to:

from pathlib import Path
✅ Action Summary
Task	Status	Action Required
Script runs correctly	✅ Working	—
Folder watcher picks up files	✅ Working	—
Processed folder exists	❌ Missing	Manually create it or let script do it
Files moved to processed/ + zipped	❌ Skipped	Will fix once processed/ exists
Task Scheduler runs .exe silently	❌ Failing	Fix .exe path in Task Scheduler action
Console window visible	⚠ Sometimes	Only if .py launched manually instead of .exe
✅ After fixing above, restart your PC and confirm:
chunker_hidden.exe runs silently on boot. processed/ folder is populated and zipped files are created. No .txt remains in main chunker folder. Let me know if you want a .bat script or GUI shortcut to launch/test the hidden watcher easily. a. Add a .bat script to manually launch the hidden watcher if needed
b. Add logging output to a .log file instead of console for troubleshooting

I made the folder
i see chunker_hidden.spec not .exe
ChatGPT said:
Great job progressing through everything! You're almost there. The .spec file you're seeing (chunker_hidden.spec) is just the PyInstaller specification file. The actual executable you want should be located in:

C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist\chunker_hidden.exe
✅ Next Steps:
Navigate to the dist folder:

Open File Explorer. Go to:
C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist

Confirm the EXE:

You should see chunker_hidden.exe inside that folder. This is the final, hidden-window EXE version of your script. Update Task Scheduler (if needed):

If you’re still launching an older EXE or .py file:

Update the Action in Task Scheduler to point to:
C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist\chunker_hidden.exe

Test It:

Double-click the chunker_hidden.exe. You should not see a command window pop up. Add a .txt file to the watch folder to test it's working invisibly. Let me know if you want to:
a. Configure Task Scheduler to log output/errors to a file
b. Auto-close the original .exe after launching (just-in-case behavior)

You said:

i do not see the file in dist
ChatGPT said:
Thanks for the update! Since the dist folder is empty, that means PyInstaller didn’t run or complete the EXE build yet. ✅ Let’s build the hidden-window .exe step-by-step:
1. Open Command Prompt (cmd)
2. Run this from your chunker directory:
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile watcher_splitter.py
🔒 --noconsole: hides the window
📦 --onefile: creates a single .exe
💡 This will output your chunker_hidden.exe into dist/

3. Wait until you see:
Building EXE from EXE-00.toc completed successfully. 4. Then go to:
C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist
You should see:

watcher_splitter.exe
If you want to name it chunker_hidden.exe instead:

pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --name chunker_hidden watcher_splitter.py
Let me know once you run that, or if you get any errors! a. Want to delete build/ and __pycache__/ after the build to clean up? b. Want a shortcut on startup to silently trigger the EXE (without Task Scheduler)? You said:

Thanks — this error means you're not currently in the folder where watcher_splitter.py is located. ✅ Here's how to fix it:
1. Navigate to your script folder:
Run this in cmd:

cd C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker
2. Then re-run the build:
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --name chunker_hidden watcher_splitter.py
That should work. Let me know what you see in the dist/ folder afterward! a. Want the EXE to auto-start hidden with Windows (without Task Scheduler)? b. Want to log errors to a hidden log file if EXE fails silently? You said:

ChatGPT said:
That Task Scheduler error means your saved user credentials for the task are invalid or you’re trying to update a task created by another user/admin without sufficient rights. ✅ Fix It Step-by-Step:
✅ Option 1: Recreate the task from scratch (recommended)
Open Task Scheduler as Admin. Click “Create Task” (not basic task). On the General tab:

Name: Chunker Watcher

Check ✅ "Run whether user is logged on or not"

Check ✅ "Run with highest privileges"

On Triggers tab:

New → At log on → Any user → OK

On Actions tab:

New → Action: Start a program

Program/script: C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist\chunker_hidden.exe

Click OK → You'll be prompted to enter your Windows user password. ❌ Don't:
Don't modify an old task created by another user or elevated session. Don’t leave the password blank unless it's a service account with no password (uncommon). Once recreated, restart and confirm:

.exe runs (check Task Manager chunker_hidden.exe). Files are still monitored and processed. No console window appears. a. Want to silently log all errors into a logs/watcher.log file? b. Want the .exe to detect and auto-relaunch if it crashes or is closed? You said:

✅ Awesome! Everything looks good now. Here’s what you’ve accomplished:

✅ Summary of What’s Done:
chunker_hidden.exe was successfully built using PyInstaller with --noconsole ✔️

You created a proper Task Scheduler task that launches it silently ✔️

.exe now lives at:

C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist\chunker_hidden.exe
✅ Final Checklist
✅ Task	Status
dist/ folder contains .exe	✅ Done
.exe launches silently (invisible window)	✅ Done (via --noconsole)
Task Scheduler triggers the .exe at logon	✅ Confirmed
.exe keeps watching watch_folder	✅ Should be happening now
💡 You Can Now:
Restart your PC and confirm that the script starts automatically and invisibly. Drop a .txt file into the watch_folder and verify it gets processed. Check:

✅ processed/ gets updated

✅ archive/ contains backup

✅ output/ folder is cleaned

✅ Cloud folder contains uploaded summary

✅ Optional Nice-to-Haves
a. Want logs written to a .log file silently for error/debug tracking? b. Want the Task Scheduler to restart the script if it crashes? Let me know which you'd like and I’ll help implement! You said:
should i add a new .txt file to chunker before i restart? ChatGPT said:
No need to add a .txt file before restarting. Here's why:

🔁 What Happens Either Way:
Action	Result
You restart without a .txt	Watcher will silently activate in the background, waiting for new files ✅
You restart with a .txt already in chunker/	It may or may not get picked up, depending on file creation timestamp and the way watchdog detects events ⚠️
✅ Recommended:
Restart your system. Wait 5–10 seconds after login. Then drop a new .txt file into the watch_folder (chunker/).
