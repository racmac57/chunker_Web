Confirm it’s processed (output in processed/, archive/, etc.). Let me know when you're ready to test that, or if you want to add logging to double-check it started silently after reboot. a. Add a startup log message written to a .log file? b. Set up error alerts (e.g. popup or cloud log)? You said:
ok be right back
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — I'll be right here when you're back. Good luck with the restart! 🚀

a. When you're back: drop a .txt into chunker/ to test
b. Then check processed/ & archive/ folders to confirm it's working

You said:
After the restart, I waited 5 to 10 seconds and then added a new text file into the folder, and the CHUNKER window opened up and remains on the screen. ChatGPT said:
✅ That means everything is working — the EXE launched and is watching the folder! However, if you want the Chunker window to stay hidden, we now need to run the EXE silently at startup. ✅ You've already done:
Created chunker_hidden.exe with --noconsole ✔️

Set it up in Task Scheduler ✔️

Confirmed that it runs on file drop ✔️

🧩 But why is the window still appearing? If you see the window, it likely means:

Task Scheduler is launching Python directly (not the .exe)

Or it's launching .exe without Hidden mode

✅ Fix it — Run EXE Silently via Task Scheduler
Open Task Scheduler

Right-click your Chunker Watcher task → Properties

In Actions tab:

Click Edit...

Program/script:

C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist\chunker_hidden.exe
Leave Add arguments blank

Start in (optional):

C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist
Now switch to the General tab:

✅ Check: Run whether user is logged in or not

✅ Check: Do not store password (if available)

✅ Check: Run with highest privileges

📉 At the bottom: Configure for → Windows 11

Save the task

🔁 Final Step
Reboot your machine again to confirm that:

✅ The watcher works

✅ The window stays hidden

Let me know if you'd like to:
a. Add a task tray notification instead of the window
b. Log each startup into a .log file for debugging

ChatGPT said:
Thanks! You're nearly done — the Task Scheduler has successfully started the process at login, but the CHUNKER window appears because it’s still launching in visible mode. ✅ Confirmed from your screenshot:
Task status: Running

Trigger: At logon of any user

Result: The chunker_hidden.exe runs, but window is still shown

✅ Here's what to do next to hide the window on startup:
1. Verify PyInstaller build used --noconsole
You already built using:

pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --name chunker_hidden watcher_splitter.py
✔ Good — this prevents a black terminal window from opening. 2. ✅ Double-check Task Scheduler's action
In Task Scheduler > Actions > Edit:

Program/script:

C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist\chunker_hidden.exe
Make sure you're launching the .exe, not the .py or a console stub. 3. ✅ Make sure "Start in" is NOT empty
Under "Actions" > Edit Action:

Set Start in (optional) to:

C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist
4. ✅ Configure to run invisibly
From your second screenshot, you're already set to:

“Run whether user is logged on or not” ✅

“Run with highest privileges” ✅

These settings are correct. 🔁 Optional: Hide via VBScript launcher
If the console window still pops up, add a wrapper .vbs file:

Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
WshShell.Run chr(34) & "C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist\chunker_hidden.exe" & Chr(34), 0
Save this as launch_chunker.vbs, and use this file as the Task Scheduler Action instead of the .exe. You're nearly there! ✅ Summary Steps Recap:

Confirm Task runs .exe, not .py

Use --noconsole in PyInstaller (✔ already done)

Add "Start in" path in Task

Use .vbs launcher if window still appears

a. Want me to generate the launch_chunker.vbs file for you? b. Want to add a logging mechanism so it logs silent errors into logs/ folder when running invisibly? You said:
Uploaded image
Uploaded image
do i save the .vbs in the dist folder? ChatGPT said:
Yes — you should place the .vbs file in the **same folder as the .exe**, typically your dist` folder, for simplicity and reliability. 🔧 Why:
Task Scheduler will run the .vbs, and the .vbs will launch the .exe. If they are in the same folder, you can use a simple, fixed path without worrying about inconsistencies. ✅ Steps to finalize:
Save the following as launch_chunker.vbs in your dist folder:

Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
WshShell.Run chr(34) & "C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist\chunker_hidden.exe" & Chr(34), 0
Set WshShell = Nothing
In Task Scheduler:

Edit the Action → Program/script:

wscript
Add arguments:

"C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist\launch_chunker.vbs"
Start in (optional):

C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist
Save the Task and test it. Now on reboot or user login, your Python app will run in the background without the console window. a. Want to hide the window but keep logs of any errors to debug later? b. Want to add a balloon notification or tray icon that shows it's running? You said:

Edit the Action → Program/script:
ChatGPT said:
To run the .vbs script invisibly at startup, here's exactly how your Action settings should look in Task Scheduler:

✅ Correct Setup
Program/script:

wscript
Add arguments (optional):

"C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist\launch_chunker.vbs"
Start in (optional):

C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist
🛠 Why the correction is needed:
Right now your Program/script field incorrectly has the .vbs file path. You should be launching it with wscript, and passing the .vbs file as an argument. Once updated, click OK to save the task. The .vbs script will launch your .exe in the background without showing a window on startup. a. Want to log output to a hidden .log file for troubleshooting? b. Want to also auto-kill any prior watcher process on startup? You said:

correct now? ChatGPT said:
Almost perfect — just a tiny fix in the Add arguments field. 🔧 Fix:
Change this:

list\launch_chunker.vbs"
To this:

"C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist\launch_chunker.vbs"
So the complete setup becomes:

✅ Final Correct Configuration
Program/script:

wscript
Add arguments (optional):

"C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist\launch_chunker.vbs"
Start in (optional):

C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist
Then click OK, and your task will launch the chunker EXE invisibly at startup 🎯

a. Want to confirm it's hidden after reboot with a test .txt? b. Want to create a launch_kill.vbs to terminate old watcher if it’s still running? You said:
I have 
Arguments: "C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist\launch_chunker.vbs"
Start in: C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist

do i change these? ChatGPT said:
✅ That setup is 100% correct — no need to change anything. ✔️ Final Check:
Program/script:
wscript

Add arguments:
"C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist\launch_chunker.vbs"

Start in:
C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker\dist

You're good to go. It will:

Launch at logon (any user),

Run the .vbs invisibly,

Start chunker_hidden.exe silently in the background. a. Want to test by restarting again and watching Task Manager for the .exe? b. Want to log chunker activity to a text file for debugging if needed? You said:

ChatGPT said:
Perfect ✅ — here’s how to test it cleanly:

🔁 Restart & Test Steps
Save all work. Restart your computer. Once you're back in:

Wait ~10 seconds after login. Open Task Manager → Details tab. Look for: chunker_hidden.exe

Then:

Drop a fresh .txt into your watched folder. Check if the processing happens silently (window should NOT pop up). If chunker_hidden.exe is in the list and processes your file:
✔️ Mission accomplished — it’s running in background as expected. If anything doesn't behave as expected:
📌 Let me know what you observe — we’ll debug fast. a. Want me to help log each run to a text file for audit/debug? b. Want to convert this into a .msi installer or tray app for easier management? You said:
Waited approximately 10 to 20 seconds. Opened up Task Scheduler. Upon opening up Task Scheduler, the CHUNKER command window opened up as well. Should I drop in a text file into the folder? ChatGPT said:
Yes — go ahead and drop a new .txt file into the watched folder now. We’re confirming two things:

✅ Whether the Task Scheduler launched the app on login (we’ve confirmed: it did, though not invisibly — yet). ✅ Whether the watcher correctly detects and processes the dropped file. If it processes the file and moves it to the appropriate folders (output, processed, etc. ), we’ll know the logic is working fine. Next, we’ll just need to fix the window visibility so it stays hidden after login. Let’s do this in 2 phases:

Phase A (Now): Drop in the .txt and observe file processing. Phase B (Next): Hide the window 100% reliably. a. Want me to tweak the script so it logs to a file instead of showing a window? b. Want to test a fully invisible .vbs launcher fix with logging? You said:
I drag the file into the folder and receive the attached message below. 2025-06-27 14:08:05,000 [INFO] Starting folder watcher...

**********************************************************************
ChatGPT said:
Great catch — your script runs and detects files, but it errors out due to a missing NLTK resource: punkt_tab. ✅ Root Cause
Although you downloaded punkt earlier (nltk.download('punkt')), NLTK is trying to access punkt_tab, a related internal file, and it's missing in the runtime environment of the .exe. When you run Python manually, NLTK downloads go into:

C:\Users\carucci_r\AppData\Roaming\nltk_data
But when running the compiled .exe, PyInstaller doesn’t include NLTK data files by default, and the runtime doesn’t know how to find them unless bundled. ✅ Fix
We need to manually include NLTK’s data in the build. Here's how:

🛠️ Step-by-Step Fix
1. Download the needed resource manually
Run this in a Python shell:

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
Then check this path on your system:

C:\Users\carucci_r\AppData\Roaming\nltk_data\tokenizers\punkt
It should contain:

english.pickle
punkt.pickle
punkt.utf8
punkt_tab
2. Tell PyInstaller to bundle nltk_data
Update your .spec file (chunker_hidden.spec) to include:

# Near the top
from PyInstaller.utils.hooks import collect_data_files
import nltk

# Add this to a.datas += ...
nltk_data_path = nltk.data.find("tokenizers/punkt").path
a.datas += Tree(nltk_data_path, prefix="nltk_data/tokenizers/punkt")
Or more simply:

a.datas += Tree("C:/Users/carucci_r/AppData/Roaming/nltk_data", prefix="nltk_data")
(Use raw path if needed: r"C:\...")

3. Rebuild with PyInstaller
In the chunker folder:

pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --name chunker_hidden chunker_hidden.spec
4. Confirm .exe now processes files without error
Drop the same file and verify no more punkt_tab error. a. Want me to rewrite the .spec file for you with this change? b. Want to make a fallback download attempt in the script if punkt isn't found? You said:

Perfect — you've confirmed:

✅ NLTK punkt is downloaded and present in:

C:\Users\carucci_r\AppData\Roaming\nltk_data\tokenizers\punkt
✅ Now let's bundle it into your PyInstaller build
📄 Open chunker_hidden.spec and update it like this:
# chunker_hidden.spec

# Add at the top:
from PyInstaller.utils.hooks import collect_data_files
from PyInstaller.building.build_main import Tree

# In the `a = Analysis(...)` section:
a.datas += Tree("C:/Users/carucci_r/AppData/Roaming/nltk_data", prefix="nltk_data")
Make sure to use forward slashes / or raw string r"C:\...". 🔁 Rebuild with PyInstaller
cd C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --name chunker_hidden chunker_hidden.spec
✅ Verify
Drop a text file again. The .exe should now run silently with no punkt_tab error. Logs should show chunking completed without failure. Let me know if you want the .spec rewritten for you. a. Want to test by copying the nltk_data folder into a custom location first? b. Want the fallback logic inside watcher_splitter.py to download punkt at runtime if not found? You said:
do i use the code you provided and replace the existing
ChatGPT said:
✅ Spec file updated to include nltk_data folder so PyInstaller can bundle it with the .exe. ✅ What's next:
Rebuild your .exe using this command:

pyinstaller chunker_hidden.spec
After build finishes, copy the new chunker_hidden.exe to dist/ folder. Replace the old .exe in Task Scheduler with this newly built one (if needed). a. Want me to make a .bat file that runs this PyInstaller build command? b. Want help verifying nltk is bundled correctly into the final .exe? You said:
where do I add this? pyinstaller chunker_hidden.spec
ChatGPT said:
You said:
where do I add this? pyinstaller chunker_hidden.spec
ChatGPT said:
You should run this command in Command Prompt from the same folder where chunker_hidden.spec is located, which is:

C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker
✅ Steps:
Open Command Prompt. Run:

cd C:\Users\carucci_r\Documents\chunker
Then run:

pyinstaller chunker_hidden.spec
This will re-build your .exe with the new nltk_data directory bundled. Let me know once it completes, and I’ll guide you to test it next. a. Add logging to verify punkt loads correctly at runtime
b. Bundle nltk_data directly with PyInstaller using --add-data

✅ You're almost there. The error:

PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied: '...\\dist\\chunker_hidden.exe'
means chunker_hidden.exe is still running, likely from your Scheduled Task. 🔧 Fix:
Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)

Look for chunker_hidden.exe under the Processes tab

Right-click → End Task

Then re-run the command:

pyinstaller chunker_hidden.spec
This will regenerate the .exe and include nltk_data from the .spec file bundle. Let me know once that’s done! a. Add runtime logs to confirm nltk resource is found
b. Add logging.exception for better error diagnostics
