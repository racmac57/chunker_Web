Carrillo were out with a possible stolen vehicle in front of 86 Anderson Street.  P.O. McCarthy requested the return on the New Jersey temporary plate W528180 affixed to the recovered stolen vehicle.  A check showed that vehicle is a 2019 Honda Pilot 4 door colored white.  P.O. McCarthy advised that the recovered vehicle matched the description of the 2019 Honda Pilot.  I conducted a commercialized computer database search which yielded that the 2019 Honda Pilot had approximately 30,000 miles when it was in a crash resulting in the vehicle being a total loss/salvage.  The vehicle was only owned in Ohio and was never registered in New Jersey.  A public records search of that vehicle yielded an auction web-site which showed that damage to the vehicle.  I advised P.O. McCarthy of the damage, to which P.O. McCarthy advised that the vehicle appeared to be new and did not have any obvious signs of prior damage.               P.O. McCarthy and P.O. Carrillo advised Headquarters that a potential owner, Perez-Lopez, had approached them and stated that the car belonged to her.  She further stated that the vehicle was purchased at an auction by her husband, Fernandez, who works for Exclusive Auto Gallery in Paterson, NJ.  Perez-Lopez was able to turn the vehicle on with a key fob.  P.O. McCarthy advised me that the vehicle had a New Jersey inspection sticker which had an expiration date of 5/25.  A check of the recovered stolen vehicle showed that the vehicle was purchased in 5/2020.  Based on the purchase date, I was aware that the inspection expiration date would be 5/25.  P.O. McCarthy also advised me that the odometer showed that the vehicle did not have more than 10,000 miles.  P.O. McCarthy also advised me that the public VIN matched the VIN on the temporary plate, but the door frame VIN appeared to be bubbling.                  I responded to the scene and met with P.O. McCarthy, P.O. Carrillo, and Perez-Lopez.  I looked at the door frame VIN and observed that it was both bubbling and peeling.  I also saw that the sticker stated ""MFD. BY HONDA MFG. OF ALABAMA, LLC"" instead of ""AMERICA.""  The door frame VIN sticker also stated that the vehicle had 18 inch rims, however the door frame tire sticker stated that the vehicle had 20 inch rims.  I checked the tires and observed that the rims were in fact 20 inch rims. I then began to peel the door frame VIN sticker which peeled right off.  A real VIN sticker would disintegrate on the door as it was being peeled.  Based on the discrepancy with the inspection sticker, the discrepancy with the mileage, the misprint of Alabama instead of America, the initial call from SiriusXM in reference to the stolen vehicle, the difference in rims, the door frame sticker not disintegrating while being removed, as well as my training and experience, I advised P.O. Carrillo to request consent to search (See P.O. Carrillo's original incident report for further).                 P.O. McCarthy and I conducted a search of the vehicle.  I located the Frame VIN which I confirmed was the same as the stolen vehicle (VIN #5FNYF6H98LB050108).  In the engine compartment, I located a small black piece of the vehicle which was broken off.  The black piece had ""COVER, VIN PLATE ""imprinted on it and the rivet holes on the piece lined up with the rivets on the public VIN.  I also pressed the emergency button near the rear view mirror.  The operator confirmed that the vehicle that I pressed the emergency button on belonged to a Sandra Reyes, whom reported the vehicle stolen.  I advised P.O. Carrillo to place Perez-Lopez under arrest.                The vehicle was impounded by Hackensack Towing.","","","NJ","z74mjy","nj","W528180","7","","","","10","","","","","b4","","","","","","","7","Sunday","2021","11","7","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PIL","86 Anderson Street"

I explained to the suspect that he both had the rights to refuse a search as well as to terminate a search at any time.  The suspect consented to a search of the vehicle.  I went to the secret VIN location which I observed to be modified and fictitious.             Due to me being unable to obtain the real VIN for the vehicle, the suspect was issued summons #E22-19933 for a violation of 39:3-4.

Based on the confirmation that the federal door VIN sticker was fictitious, the secret VIN being modified, as well as all aforementioned factors which led to the consent search, I had probable cause to conduct a check of the VIN through the OBD2 port.  I then followed the vehicle to the impound yard to conduct the OBD2 check.  Court House Towing personnel plugged into the OBD2 port and retrieved the real VIN (SALWZ2SEXKA860045).  I confirmed that the real VIN was reported stolen out of Colts Neck Police Department.             I then responded to Headquarters to prepare complaints against the suspect.  I signed complaint #W2022-000428-0223 against the suspect for violations of 2C:20-7a and 2C:17-6b.

While patrolling the parking lot of 405 Route 17 South, we observed vehicle 1 bearing a Florida Dealership registration PK733B, parked idling, in violation 39:3-70.2, in the parking lot in front of Metro PCS. A Police database search of the public VIN (5UXCY8C04M9J02739) returned that the VIN was not a valid VIN. Thereafter, marked radio car #148 was repositioned to block in vehicle 1 from leaving the scene. Our body worn cameras were activated. While attempting to locate the real VIN on vehicle 1, a party later identified as Mr. Raymier Mondesir, approached us and stated vehicle 1 belonged to him. After explaining to Mr. Mondesir that vehicle 1 was possibly stolen, he changed his statement and stated that the vehicle belongs to a client. Mr. Mondesir was detained. A computer search for any outstanding warrants yielded negative. The driver's side door was opened. We observed that the federal VIN sticker was fraudulent. The federal VIN sticker, which beared 5UXCY8C04M9J02739, was removed. Based on the public VIN showing it is not a valid VIN the federal VIN sticker being fraudulent as well as our training and experience, we have probable cause to believe the vehicle was stolen and the original VIN was altered. A probable cause search was conducted to locate the real VIN. The Florida dealership registration was removed from the rear of vehicle 1 and secured in radio car #148. From our training and experience, the vehicle's VIN can also be accessed from the rear of BMWs. The original VIN sticker was tampered, removed and replaced with a different peeling sticker VIN 5UXCY8C04M9J02739, which matched the public VIN.  It should be noted that above this sticker was remnants of the glue from the original VIN sticker.     Mr. Mondesir was asked on how did he start the vehicle. He reported through an application on his phone. Mr. Mondesir refused to demonstrate on how to start the vehicle. Mr. Mondesir was explained that the vehicle is being impounded due to our reasonable suspicion that the vehicle is possibly stolen. Mr. Mondesir was dispersed from the scene. While attempting to start the vehicle, we were able to access the vehicle's real VIN ""5UXCY8C08N9J45952"" from the vehicle's heads up display/center console screen. A computer search on that VIN indicated that vehicle 1 was stolen out of Lantana, Florida. A probable cause search of the stolen vehicle yielded four (4) cell phones, a bag and a document from Florida in reference to a doctor referral. Within in the bag, two (2) credit cards in various names were located and turned over to Det. Mora.          We attempted to locate Mr. Mondesir with negative results.The stolen vehicle was impounded by All Points Towing.See TOW, evidence and property report.          The stolen vehicle is valued at $93,360.00.

On the first level of the parking deck of 400 Hackensack Avenue (a quasi-public parking garage open to any patron of the mall and regularly patrolled by members of the Hackensack Police Department), I located a black Land Rover Range Rover bearing New Jersey used car dealer plate DQL68.  A public records check of that business (Atlantic Auto Group LLC) showed that the business is permanently closed.  I walked to the front of the vehicle to observed the Public VIN (salgs5se7ma451417) which I immediately recognized as fraudulent.  The Public VIN shows that the vehicle is a 2021 Land Rover Range Rover.  A Police records database check yielded that the VIN is in fact fraudulent.  Based on the window etching on the windows, I believed the vehicle to be either a 2019 or 2020 and not a 2021.             Lt. Weber responded to assist.  I attempted to locate a driver for the unoccupied vehicle, with negative results.              Based on the public VIN being fraudulent, the used car dealer license plate showing that the business is permanently closed, as well as my training and experience, I had probable cause to believe that the vehicle is stolen and the VINs were altered.

I observed the federal VIN sticker in the door jam to be fraudulent.  As I attempting to locate the real VIN, Zhang walked up to the vehicle and unlocked the vehicle with a key fob.  Zhang was asked if he was the owner, which he stated that he bought the vehicle for approximately $40000.00.  I opened the engine hood and observed the secondary VIN to be also altered.  Using the key fob, I started the vehicle.  I located the real VIN (salgs5se3la579409) which was confirmed to be stolen on 4/13/2022 by the New York City Police Department (NIC #V553876607).   A probable cause search of the vehicle yielded no further items of evidentiary value.               I placed Zhang under arrest for possession of a stolen motor vehicle (valued at approximately $90000.00) as well as possession of a motor vehicle with an altered VIN.

While on patrol, I observed a gray Dodge Challenger parked in front of 200 Central Avenue bearing NJ/ F30LJJ.  The vehicle had no front license plate, an expired inspection, front tinted windows, as well as a license plate device used to flip a license plate to a different license plate.  The VIN associated with the license plate (2C3CDZAG9GH231989) came back to an SXT Challenger with a 3.6L non turbo motor.  Guerrero approached the vehicle and turned the vehicle on.  I conducted a motor vehicle stop based on the title 39 violations.  P.O. Almonte responded to assist.  While speaking with the driver, he advised me that he bought the vehicle a few years ago and it was not a HELLCAT, but rather an SXT with a front bumper swap.            I asked Guerrero to step out of the vehicle, which he complied.  I observed the public window VIN to be 2C3CDZAG9GH231989.  I observed the federal VIN sticker to peel off.  Based on the vehicle appearing to be a HELLCAT trim, the federal VIN sticker peeling off, as well as my training and experience, I had probable cause to believe that the vehicle was stolen and had a re-vin of the SXT.  I was able to retrieve the real VIN, which was 2C3CDZC95GH344451.  This VIN was confirmed to be stolen on 8/26/2018 in Elizabeth Port, NJ.            Guerrero was placed under arrest, placed in handcuffs behind his back, searched, and placed in the rear seat of Radio Car 105.  I conducted a probable cause search of the vehicle with negative results for contraband.  The secondary VIN was found to be modified.  The passenger was dispersed from the area being that the fake VIN was registered in Guerrero's name.  The vehicle was impounded by All Points Towing.              Guerrero was transported to Headquarters.  The rear seat of Radio Car 105 was checked prior to and after Guerrero's occupancy with negative results for contraband  Guerrero was searched a second time.  Guerrero was processed.  I signed complaint #0223S2022-569 against Guerrero for violations of 2C:20-7a.  I also issued Guerrero the following summonses:Summons #E22-26335 for a violation of 39:3-74Summons #E22-26336 for a violation of 39:3-4Summons #E22-26337 for a violation of 39:3-33Summons #E22-26338 for a violation of 39:3-38Summons #E22-26339 for a violation of 39:3-33ASummons #E22-26340 for a violation of 39:3-77Summons #E22-26341 for a violation of 39:8-1Guerrero was released on the summonses.All Points Towing transported the vehicle to Headquarters where I removed the public window VIN.

An employee of Court House Towing stated that they impounded the vehicle from South Hackensack due to it being reported stolen by Pennsylvania State Police after it was located by an employee of Geico Insurance.  The Court House Towing employee stated that something felt weird with the vehicle.  I observed the public window VIN to be fictitious.  A Police database check confirmed that the VIN was in fact fictitious.   It should be noted that the New Jersey license plate on the vehicle with the fictitious VIN was registered to the suspect who resided in Hackensack at that time.         I was able to locate a NJTR-1 crash report taken by the Paterson Police on 4/8/2022 at 0012 hours (Crash occurred at Market Street/E 42nd Street, Paterson NJ).  In the crash report, the owner, who was the driver of the vehicle, was the suspect. I spoke with TFC. Colm Hirschmann from the Pennsylvania State Police, who entered the vehicle as stolen.  TFC. Hirschmann stated that somebody attempted to title the fictitious VIN through the Pennsylvania DMV, which prompted him to report the vehicle stolen until the real VIN could be determined.Due to the vehicle appearing to be a high-end re-vin, I contacted Agent Stanicki from the NICB to confirm the real VIN.  Agent Stanicki reached out to me and advised me that the secondary VIN on the vehicle was completely removed.

Sergio Raneli 312","12/14/22","13:17","110","55","Route 4 East","","12/14/2022","13:17","    On Wednesday, December 14, 2022, the Narcotics Bureau was contacted by Carteret P.D. Special Investigation Unit (SIU) regarding a auto crime cell operating in Hackensack and throughout the tri-state area. Carteret P.D. further advised D/Sgt. Dalton that on 12/13/22, a victim responded to the Carteret P.D. to file a police report. See original case report as transcribed by PO Sanfilippo (Carteret PD.) The victim reported that on 12/10/22, he purchased a 2021 Honda CRV for $22,000.00 in United States Currency (USC) in the parking lot of Coach House Diner from an unknown Hispanic male (UHM), later identified Dariel ACEVEDO. On 12/13/22, the victim attempted to register the vehicle at DMV, at which time he was advised that the vehicle was re-vinned and confirmed stolen. As a result, the Narcotics Bureau and Carteret P.D. Special Investigations Unit initiated a joint investigation into ACEVEDO and any additional co-conspirators. On 12/14/22, at the direction of the Hackensack Police Department Narcotics Bureau and Carteret P.D., an Undercover (UC) posed as the victim's son-in-law and made phone contact with ACEVEDO to facilitate the purchase of a second vehicle. ACEVEDO advised the UC that he would meet the UC at the Coach House Diner located at 55 Route 4 east to sell him a white 2022 Honda CRV for the negotiated price of $22,000.00 in USC.     At approximately 1145 hours, members of the Carteret Special Investigations Unit responded to the Hackensack Police Department. A briefing was held in the Detectives Bureau prior to the UC buy. The purpose of the briefing was to inform all law enforcement personnel of the prearranged plan for the UC to purchase a White, 2022 Honda CRV. After the briefing, all personnel responded to 55 Route 4 East (Coach House Diner) and established stationary surveillance. It should be noted that a Law Enforcement inquiry revealed ACEVEDO had numerous active ATS warrants.     At approximately 1317 hours, a white Honda CRV being operated by ACEVEDO arrived in the lot of Coach House Diner bearing a fictitious NJ temporary tag (NJ/S537129.). Upon the UC making contact with ACEVEDO, members of the Carteret Special Investigations Unit and the Hackensack Narcotics Bureau moved in and detained ACEVEDO. I observed the public vin that was displayed on the outer portion of the vehicle near the driver side windshield, which I believed to be fraudulent. That fraudulent vin near the windshield appeared to be a sticker which was the same vin number that matched on the fictitious temporary New Jersey registration that was affixed to the rear of the vehicle. Based on the totality of the circumstances, and my training, education and experience, I have first hand knowledge that cloning of vins is a way to mask the true identity of stolen cars. Based on the aforementioned, and the fact that ACEVEDO recently sold the same make and model to the initial victim which was confirmed stolen, I had probable cause to believe that the vehicle in question was likely stolen.      As a result, a probable cause search of the vehicle was conducted by D/Sgt. Dalton and I. Upon entering the vehicle, I observed the same fraudulent vin throughout the entire vehicle, including the secret vin located underneath the floor board of the front passenger side floor. Upon further inspection I observed welding marks ""Tooling"" around the entirety of the secret vin which is not consistent with factory manufacturing. This raised my suspicion even further believing a after market alteration to the vehicle, specifically the secret vin had occurred. I was then able to chisel out the fake vin (2HKRW2H83NH962007) which was stamped on a peice of metal and welded to the vehicle. Once removed, I observed a layer of Bondo which is a putty body filler commonly used to fill voids, repair dents, fill holes. I have direct knowledge that Bondo is used when specifically altering a vehicle for criminal activity such as hidden compartment ""traps"" and re-vinning vehicles. Once I scrapped the Bondo off it revealed the true   vin number (2HKRW2H81NH669237) to the vehicle.         It was determined that the listed vehicle was re-vinned and confirmed stolen out of the City of New York NIC# V144604630. ACEVEDO was arrested by the Carteret Special Investigations Unit along with the Hackensack Narcotics Bureau for receiving stolen property, 2C:20-7. Search incident to arrest yielded an unknown amount of United States Currency in ACEVEDO'S left Jean pocket. It was later determined the USC totaled $1,256.13, which is believed to be illicit proceeds derived from illegal activity and seized. Additionally, ACEVEDO was charged for original incident which occurred on 12/10/22 for fencing stolen property, 2C:20-7.1b(1) and receiving stolen property, 2C:20-7.     Shortly thereafter, Hackensack Auto Body responded to take possession of the vehicle and one key fob. See tow report for further.      Prior to the listed vehicle being towed, Carteret PD seized the following paperwork as evidence.- Fraudulent New Jersey Temp Tag - Suspected Fraudulent New York State Motor Vehicle Title - Fraudulent Federal Vin- Two (2) suspected fraudulent New Jersey ID Cards - Fraudulent Metal Vin- Fraudulent Bill of Sale issued by New York State.        *See evidence report for further details*          ACEVEDO was issued the following motor vehicle summonses, 39: 3-33/fictitious plates, 39:3-4/unregistered, 39:3-40/suspended and 39:6B2/failure to produce insurance. These summonses were issued and mailed to mailing address provided by ACEVEDO.         D/Sgt. Dalton advised communications and requested a marked unit respond for prisoner transport. Shortly thereafter, PO Seretis responded, took custody of ACEVEDO and placed him in the rear of Radio Car #120. Radio Car #120 was checked prior to and after transport yielding negative results for any contraband.       At Police Headquarters, communications conducted a warrant check on ACEVEDO which revealed five (5) active ATS warrants. They are as follows:1. Warrant #C53082 was issued on 06/23/2022 in violation of 39:3-40 out of River Edge, NJ. 2.

Briggs advised me that while on patrol in fully marked police uniform, he observed the vehicle parked in the parking lot unoccupied bearing a New Jersey 30-Day Non-Resident Temporary Plate 609415T. While verifying the information on the temporary registration, he discovered no return on the listed VIN W1NYC6BJ6LX345718. He believed the vehicle was possibly stolen and re VINed.

The parking lot of 90 Main Street is a quasi-public parking lot being used by a few different businesses in the area.  The parking lot is also improperly used by patrons of Koala Lounge.  As I pulled into the parking lot, Owusu observed my Radio Car.  Owusu immediately exited his vehicle and walked southbound on Main Street to City Lobster.  I conducted a check of the Florida Plate, which was registered to Davis.  A check of the VIN (salgs2rexks577363) associated with the vehicle yielded unusual vehicle history, commonly associated with a stolen vehicle that has a fictitious VIN.  I approached the vehicle to look at the public VIN in the windshield.  Based on my training and experience, I immediately recognized the public VIN sticker in the windshield to be fraudulent as it was the wrong type of material and lacked the necessary security features.        I requested a tow truck to open the vehicle so that I could conduct a probable cause search to locate the real VIN.

On the back seat, I located a medium sized OnTheGo Louis Vuitton bag containing a small blue box with small earrings (possible diamond earrings) and various clothing items.  No identification was located in this bag either.  Based on the vehicle being stolen with a fictitious VIN, higher-end purses in the vehicle, no identification with the belongings, a third party being in possession of the stolen vehicle, as well as my training and experience, I seized the two bags, shoes, and earrings as possible proceeds of criminal activity.          All Points Towing impounded the vehicle.

Also observed on the driver's side quarter panel and rear bumper were two bullet holes (one in each).             Based on the bullet holes in the vehicle, the fictitious/altered registration, the concealment of the public VIN,  the designer bag that appeared to be in the shape of a firearm, along with my training and experience, I believed that there was a firearm in the vehicle that was not being stored properly for transport, along with other evidence of criminal activity.  I requested a patrol/explosives K-9.  While we were waiting for the K-9, I observed the vehicle being manually locked two separate times by a remote key fob.  This action raised my suspicion that someone in the area was observing our actions, and would make an attempt to gain access to the vehicle.  Based on my heightened awareness, I observed  a dark skinned male wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt walked past the vehicle twice.  S.O. O'Neill #1685 and his K-9 ""Max"" arrived on scene.  S.O. O'Neill and K-9 conducted a sweep (case #BS-24-018967) which did not result in a  positive indication.  I then requested a narcotics K-9, and S.O. Moussavian #1730 and K-9 ""Cash"" responded.  S.O. Moussavian and his partner conducted a sweep of the vehicle (case #BS-24-018971).  S.O. Moussavian advised that his K-9 indicated on the vehicle.  During one of the K-9 sweeps, I observed the same male with a blue hooded sweatshirt walk past a third time.Based on the bullet holes on the vehicle,  the fictitious/altered registration, the concealment of the public VIN, the designer bag that appeared to be in the shape of a firearm, my training and experience, the positive indication by a narcotics K-9, and belief that there was an individual in the area with a key to the vehicle, a probable cause search was conducted.  As I initiated my search I checked underneath the driver's seat.  I located a black handle Interarms model M720 .44 S&W caliber handgun (serial #AB106117) un-holstered underneath the seat.  The firearm was loaded with 5 hollow-point .44 S&W rounds.   In the designer bag (Christian Dior) on the back seat was two passports belonging to Carlos Taveras as well as a Louis Vuitton small zipper style bag.  Inside of this bag was a social security card belonging to Carlos Taveras, a New York benefits card for Carlos Taveras, a CitiBank debit card for Carlos Taveras, 2 New York birth certificates, three pawn slips and a ABM work id with Carlos Taveras information and photo on it.  There were also 5 .44 s&w hollow point rounds in the bag.  The hang tag which was blocking the public VIN from Hackensack Gardens, LLC bearing #175 was removed and secured. P.O. Price located two rounds in a green bag in the glove box (1 round .40 s&w hollow point ammo, 1 round of 9mm luger ammo) as well as one watch and one chain.  In the center console, P.O.
