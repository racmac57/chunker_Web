What does the power platform cost



## Response:

Let me break down the Power Platform licensing costs specifically for government organizations. These are U.S. Government Community (GCC) prices as of early 2024:

1. Power Apps (for custom applications):
- Per User: ~$8/user/month
- Per App: ~$5/user/app/month (minimum 5 licenses)

2. Power Automate (for workflows):
- Per User: ~$15/user/month
- Per Flow: ~$100/flow/month (for unattended automation)
- Basic flows included with Microsoft 365

3. Power BI (for reporting):
- Pro: ~$10/user/month
- Premium Per User: ~$20/user/month
- Premium Per Capacity: ~$4,995/month (for entire organization)

Cost-Saving Tips:
1. Start with Microsoft 365's included features:
- Basic Power Automate flows
- SharePoint lists
- Microsoft Forms

2. Consider mixed licensing:
- Get per-user licenses for power users
- Use per-app licenses for occasional users
- Leverage included M365 features for others

Example Cost Scenarios:

Small Implementation (25 users):
```
10 full users × $8 (Power Apps) = $80
10 full users × $10 (Power BI Pro) = $100
15 per-app users × $5 = $75
Monthly Total: ~$255
```

Medium Implementation (50 users):
```
20 full users × $8 = $160
20 full users × $10 = $200
30 per-app users × $5 = $150
Monthly Total: ~$510
```

Would you like me to:
1. Create a detailed cost calculator for your specific user numbers? 2. Compare costs between different licensing approaches? 3. Show potential ROI calculations based on time savings? Remember to check with your Microsoft government representative for:
- Current exact pricing
- Volume discounts
- Special government programs
- Bundle deals with existing licenses

Would every person currently sending me data required to have a power platform



## Response:
12/25/2024, 9:59:48 PM

No, not everyone sending data would need a Power Platform license. Let me break down who needs what license based on their role:

Data Submitters (Supervisors/Officers):
- Only need their existing M365 license
- Can use Microsoft Forms to submit data
- Can view SharePoint lists
- Can receive automated notifications
- Can use Teams for collaboration

Power Platform licenses would only be needed for:
1. System Administrators (You):
   - Building the forms
   - Creating workflows
   - Managing automations
   - Developing reports

2. Data Analysts/Managers:
   - Creating custom reports
   - Building dashboards
   - Modifying workflows

Example Setup:
```
50 Total Department Members
└── 45 Data Submitters
    ✓ Use existing M365 license
    ✓ Submit via Forms
    ✓ View reports
└── 5 Power Users
    • Need Power Platform licenses
    • Build/maintain system
    • Create reports
```

You could start with:
1. Use M365 tools for data collection (Forms, SharePoint)
2. Get 1-2 Power Platform licenses for administrators
3. Add more licenses only if needed for specific capabilities

Would you like me to:
1. Show you how to set up the data collection system using just M365 tools? 2. Explain which features specifically require Power Platform licenses? 3. Create a plan for minimal licensing while maximizing functionality? ## Prompt:

Currently I am the only person who receives and does data analytics. So would my department need only to purchase a power platform account



## Response:
12/25/2024, 10:01:11 PM

Yes, exactly! Since you're the only person handling data analytics and system management, you would be the only one who needs a Power Platform license. Everyone else can continue submitting data using the basic M365 tools they already have. Here's how it would work:

Supervisors/Officers (Current M365 License):
- Submit data through Microsoft Forms
- View reports in SharePoint/Teams
- Access shared dashboards
- Receive automated notifications

You (M365 + Power Platform):
- Build and manage the forms
- Create automated workflows
- Develop analytics dashboards
- Generate reports
- Manage the entire system

Recommended License Package for You:
1. Power Apps Per User (~$8/month)
   - Create custom forms
   - Build mobile apps
   - Manage data collection

2. Power BI Pro (~$10/month)
   - Create interactive dashboards
   - Share reports department-wide
   - Connect to multiple data sources

Total Monthly Cost: ~$18/month for your license

The rest of your department would:
- Continue using existing M365 licenses
- Have full access to submit and view data
- No additional licensing needed

Would you like me to:
1. Show you what you could build with these tools? 2. Create a migration plan from your current Excel system? 3. Demonstrate the difference between what you can do now vs. with Power Platform? This approach gives you the tools you need while keeping costs minimal for the department. ---
