# ClaudeExportFixer

Python CLI to normalize Claude/Claude.ai export JSON/ZIP for the osteele chat viewer. ## Quick start (Windows)
```bat
cd C:\Dev\ClaudeExportFixer
scripts\windows\create_venv.bat
```

## GUI Mode

Launch a graphical interface (requires Tkinter, included in Python stdlib):

```bat
py patch_conversations.py --gui
```

Or directly:

```bat
py gui.py
```

Or use the convenient batch script:

```bat
scripts\windows\run_gui.bat
```

- Select input (`conversations.json` or `.zip`) and output paths. - Check options (e.g., `--pretty` is on by default). - Click "Run" to process; logs appear in real-time. - On success, output and report paths are shown; click "Open Output" to view the output file in your default application. - If Tkinter cannot initialize (e.g., headless environment), use CLI or run on a system with a display. ## CLI Mode

Process a JSON:

```bat
.venv\Scripts\python.exe patch_conversations.py sample\conversations.example.json -o fixed.json --pretty
```

Process a ZIP (streaming):

```bat
.venv\Scripts\python.exe patch_conversations.py export.zip -o export_patched.zip --zip-output --stream --pretty
```

Run tests:

```bat
scripts\windows\run_tests.bat
```

## Building Executables

### CLI only

```bat
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile patch_conversations.py
```

Or use the provided script:

```bat
scripts\windows\build_exe.bat
```

### GUI (windowed)

```bat
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed patch_conversations.py
```

Or use the provided script:

```bat
scripts\windows\build_exe_gui.bat
```

Output: `dist/patch_conversations.exe`. Run GUI with `--gui` flag. **Note:** No additional dependencies required; Tkinter is part of Python stdlib. For GUI-only launch without console on Windows, build with `--windowed` and run `patch_conversations.exe --gui`. ## Notes

* `ijson` is optional but required for `--stream` support. * Tkinter (for GUI) is included in Python stdlib on Windows and macOS. * See `CHANGELOG.md` for version history and changes. * See `SUMMARY.md` for project overview. * See `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines. ## Project Structure

**User**

Thank you for the detailed prompt and context. Since you've confirmed that ClaudeExportFixer v1.1.0 is production-ready with all requirements met, including the addition of `tests/test_gui_open_output.py` and updates to `CHANGELOG.md` and `README.md`, and you've reiterated the manual release steps I cannot execute (Git push, GitHub release creation), I'll focus on addressing the remaining tasks within my capabilities: creating the `LICENSE` and `.gitattributes` files. These are the only outstanding items needed before you can push to GitHub. I'll provide a concise prompt for Cursor AI to create these files, confirm the codebase status, and reiterate the manual release steps for you to execute, ensuring no other files are modified and Windows compatibility (CRLF line endings) is maintained. ---

**Prompt for Cursor AI**

The ClaudeExportFixer v1.1.0 codebase is production-ready, with `__version__ = "1.1.0"`, 13 passing tests, and complete documentation (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `tests/test_gui_open_output.py` included). All requirements are met except for adding a `LICENSE` file and `.gitattributes` to enforce line endings. Create these two files without modifying `patch_conversations.py`, `gui.py`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `tests/test_gui_import.py`, `tests/test_gui_utils.py`, `tests/test_print_logging_bridge.py`, `tests/test_gui_open_output.py`, or BAT files (`build_exe.bat`, `run_gui.bat`, `build_exe_gui.bat`). Ensure no new dependencies (stdlib + optional `ijson`) and Windows compatibility (CRLF line endings for `.gitattributes` and `LICENSE`). Provide manual release steps for the user to execute, as Cursor AI cannot perform Git or GitHub operations. ## Objectives

1. **Create LICENSE File**:
   - Create `LICENSE` with MIT License text:
     ```
     MIT License
