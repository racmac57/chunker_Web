**Subject Line:** NIBRS UCR Tab Redesign Request - Technical Specifications and Development Inquiry

---

**TO:** Ron, CEO - Lawsoft  
**FROM:** [Your Name], Principal Analyst  
**CC:** Captain Weber, Lt. Marino  
**DATE:** [Current Date]  
**RE:** NIBRS UCR Tab Redesign - Development Request and Technical Consultation

Ron,

I hope this message finds you well. Following up on our previous conversation where you mentioned the UCR tab was not in active use and could be repurposed, I'm reaching out regarding a critical enhancement to achieve full NIBRS compliance and improve our data standardization efforts. ## **Project Status**

This project is in the **early planning stages**. I've developed a comprehensive redesign mockup that I'm currently sharing with Lt. Marino and Captain Weber for internal review and approval. Once we receive their feedback and approval to proceed, we'll be ready to move forward with implementation discussions. **Interactive Mockup:** [OneDrive Link - Available to Anyone with Link]  
*This demonstrates our proposed functionality and serves as the basis for our internal review process. *

## **Project Overview**

Our current UCR/Supervisor Notes tab contains outdated elements from the pre-NIBRS era that hinder accurate crime reporting. The redesign mockup addresses NIBRS compliance requirements while streamlining officer data entry processes. ## **Current System Specifications**

**Technical Constraints:**
- **Tab dimensions:** 766×576 pixels (based on our measurements)
- **Font requirements:** 16pt Arial (current system standard)
- **Platform:** FileMaker Pro-based CAD/RMS system
- **User base:** Patrol officers with varying technical proficiency

**Current Functionality:**
- Basic text fields and simple dropdown menus
- Limited data validation
- Manual entry processes with inconsistent formatting

## **Proposed Enhancement Requirements**

**Core Functionality Needed:**
- **Multi-suspect data entry** with dynamic interface (up to 5 suspects)
- **NIBRS-compliant dropdown menus** (comprehensive lists attached)
- **Structured property and evidence tracking**
- **Standardized suspect description fields**
- **Enhanced point-of-entry documentation**

**Technical Considerations:**
- **Scrolling capability** within the 576px height constraint
- **Dropdown population** from predefined NIBRS data lists
- **Data export compatibility** for NIBRS submissions

## **FileMaker Pro Compatibility Questions**

Given our system's FileMaker Pro foundation, I have specific questions about implementation feasibility:

1. **Can your current framework support tabbed interfaces within the existing UCR tab structure? **
2. **What are the limitations for dynamic content creation (e.g., adding suspect tabs based on user input)? **
3. **Is conditional field display possible? ** (Fields that show/hide based on offense type selection - though I suspect this may be beyond current capabilities)
4. **How do you typically implement extensive dropdown lists in FileMaker Pro? **

## **Development Timeline**

While we're in the early review phase, we're seeking preliminary information about:
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Cost estimation for budget planning
- Potential development timeline
- Implementation considerations

## **Next Steps**

I've attached comprehensive technical specifications and data requirements for your preliminary review. This information will help us understand development possibilities and constraints as we finalize our internal planning. Would you be available for a brief preliminary consultation call to discuss this project's scope and feasibility? This would help inform our internal decision-making process. I look forward to exploring how we can enhance our NIBRS compliance through this system improvement. Thank you for your time and consideration. Respectfully,

## **Key Changes Made:**

✅ **Added project status context** - Makes it clear this is early-stage planning  
✅ **Referenced previous conversation** - Establishes continuity  
✅ **Emphasized internal review process** - Shows proper chain of command  
✅ **Positioned as preliminary consultation** - Reduces pressure while gathering info  
✅ **Yes, change OneDrive link to "Anyone with link"** - Allows Ron easy access  

This approach shows professionalism while making it clear you're still in the planning phase and seeking preliminary technical guidance. ## Prompt:

add to the below section indicating that I was unable to share the .html file via OneDrive because of sharing restrictions and Google Drive links were not working as expected so I shared via my Droplr account. after clicking the link you will be prompted to download "2025_05_29_17_47_32_V3_UCR_Update.html" after it downloads you will be able to see the interactive mockup. **Interactive Mockup:** Updated_UCR_Tab
*This demonstrates our proposed functionality and serves as the basis for our internal review process. *

should I add to the below email that Ron of Lawsoft was provided the mockup and data for dropdown lists and how i inquired about cost an other considerations. Sir,
I've completed a mockup redesigning our UCR/Supervisor Notes tab to improve NIBRS compliance and standardize officer reporting. This addresses outdated elements in our current system while enhancing data quality. **Design Considerations**
**NIBRS Compliance:** All data elements align with 2019 NIBRS User Manual requirements, including mandatory fields for crimes against persons and property. **Operational Focus:** Based on our common crime types (vehicle burglaries, larcenies, assaults), the design includes:
* Structured suspect descriptions replacing inconsistent free-text
* Vehicle tracking (license, make/model, distinguishing features)
* Digital evidence/CCTV documentation checkboxes
* Point-of-entry tracking for buildings and vehicles
**Technical Constraints:** Designed within existing 766×576 pixel dimensions using 16-point Arial font with dynamic suspect tabs for space efficiency. **Key Features**
* **Multi-suspect handling** with demographic fields
* **NIBRS-compliant offense codes** organized by category
* **Standardized dropdowns** for property types, weapons, entry methods
* **Crime classification flags** (domestic violence, gang-related, bias crimes)
* **Comprehensive property/evidence tracking**
**Mockup Review**
The interactive HTML mockup demonstrates dropdown navigation, multi-suspect tabs, and field organization within our system constraints. **Mockup Access:** 2025_05_29_17_47_32_V3_UCR_Update.html
*Instructions: Click link to view in browser. Best viewed in full-screen browser mode for optimal display. *
**Feedback Requested**
Please review and advise on:
* **Field priorities** for our operational needs
* **Workflow organization** - does the sequence make sense? * **Implementation concerns** for CAD/RMS integration
* **Additional elements** we should consider
**Next Steps**
Based on your feedback, I'll refine the design, present to our Lawsoft (Ron). V/r,
Officer Robert A. Carucci
Safe Streets Operations Control Center

**Next Steps**

Based on your feedback, I'll refine the design and finalize our implementation approach. I have already contacted Ron at Lawsoft and provided him with the interactive mockup and comprehensive NIBRS dropdown data lists in multiple formats (CSV, Tab-Delimited, and XML). I've also inquired about technical feasibility, development costs, implementation timeline, and FileMaker Pro compatibility considerations for this enhancement. Once I receive your approval and any requested modifications, I'll coordinate with Ron to move forward with formal development planning and budget estimation. V/r,  
Officer Robert A. Carucci

## **Why This Addition Works Well:**

✅ **Shows proactive approach** - You've already initiated vendor contact  
✅ **Demonstrates thoroughness** - Multiple data formats and comprehensive inquiry  
✅ **Establishes process flow** - Internal approval → vendor coordination  
✅ **Sets expectations** - Supervisors know next steps depend on their feedback  
✅ **Professional coordination** - Shows proper planning and resource management  

This addition reinforces that you're managing the project systematically while keeping supervisors informed of all external communications and vendor interactions. ---
