## Response:
Yes. Your **Strategic Crime Reduction Briefing Prompt** is already very close to producing the HTML output seen in the attached file. To make it match _exactly_ (layout, formatting, and content structure), add the following refinements to your current prompt:

* * *

### ✅ Add These Clarifications to the Prompt

**1\. Header Block**  
Include:

*   Title: **Strategic Crime Reduction Briefing – Patrol Captain**
*   **Date Range:** auto-filled from the data or CSV
*   **Prepared by:** P.O. R. A. Carucci
*   **Captain:** Captain Smith
*   **Version:** 1.0  
    _(Exactly as shown in the top-left layout of the attached report. )_

* * *

**2\. Section Headings**  
Use **Roman numerals** and **uppercase** titles:

```
I. BURGLARY – AUTO
II. MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT
III. ROBBERY
IV. SEXUAL OFFENSES
V. BURGLARY – COMMERCIAL
VI. BURGLARY – RESIDENCE
```

Only include sections that have data. Each section header should be bold, have a thin divider line below, and be colored **#0d233c**. * * *

**3\. Case Card Format**  
Each incident should be in a bordered, rounded box (`border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #d1d5db;`) with slight padding and no page breaks inside. Each card starts with:

```
Case {CaseNumber} | {MM/DD/YY HH:mm} | {Incident Type or Subtype} – {Statute}
```

Then bullets:

*   **Location:** {FullAddress}
*   **Grid/Zone:** {Grid} / {Zone}
*   **Parking Location:** {ParkingLocation} _(only for MV Theft / Burglary–Auto)_
*   **Victim Vehicle:** {Make} {Model} ({Plate}, {State})
*   **Suspect Description:** {Description or “Data Incomplete”}
*   **Suspect Vehicle:** {Vehicle or “Unknown”}
*   **Entry Gained / Method / Modus Operandi:** as applicable per category
*   **Loss:**
    *   {Item — $Value} (each on new line)
    *   **Total:** $###.##
*   **Status:** {Status}

* * *

**4\. Missing Field Handling**  
Where data is missing or blank, use:

```
Data Incomplete
```

in red text (`color: #b91c1c;`). * * *

**5\. Summary Table**  
At the bottom, include this exact structure:

```
| Case # | Type | Date/Time | Loss Total | Status |
|---------|------|------------|-------------|---------|
| … | … | … | … | … |
```

*   Font: DIN
*   Header color: `#0d233c`
*   Money aligned right
*   Loss totals in **red** if “Data Incomplete”, otherwise standard black
*   Show “Hackensack Police Department — Strategic Crime Analysis Unit” footer with:
    ```
    Hackensack Police Department — Strategic Crime Analysis Unit | Cycle: {CycleID}
    Generated: {MM/DD/YYYY}
    ```

* * *

**6\. HTML Styling Rules**  
Add inline CSS:

*   Font family: DIN, fallback Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif
*   Header color: `#0d233c`
*   Body text: `#1f2937`
*   Divider line: `#d1d5db`
*   Card shadow: subtle (0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.04))
*   Fit entire report on a **single printable page**
*   Avoid page breaks in cards or tables
*   Page background: `#f6f8fb`
*   Card background: `#fff`

* * *

**7\. Output Specification**  
At the end of the prompt, add this explicit instruction:

> “Return a single complete `.html` file only, using inline CSS, matching the formatting and color scheme of the attached report. The layout must fit on one page when printed to PDF. Do not return commentary or additional text.”

* * *

Once these refinements are added, your prompt will reliably produce HTML that matches the file you showed — consistent headers, card spacing, colors, and table layout. Would you like me to merge these refinements directly into your current prompt text so you have one final “ready-to-use” version for future uploads? ## Prompt:

START PROMPT

Task  
You will receive one attached CSV. Read it. Produce one single HTML file only. No extra text. Inline CSS. Match the attached example layout for “Strategic Crime Reduction Briefing – Patrol Captain.”

Output  
Return a complete .html document. Use DIN as the font. Use hex #0d233c for the title, section headers, and table header text. Fit on one page when printed to PDF. Avoid page breaks inside cards and inside the summary table. Return only the HTML. Header block  
Title: Strategic Crime Reduction Briefing – Patrol Captain

Sections and order  
Use Roman numerals and uppercase. Include a section only if it has at least one case. I. BURGLARY - AUTO  
II. MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT  
III. ROBBERY  
IV. SEXUAL OFFENSES  
V. BURGLARY - COMMERCIAL  
VI. BURGLARY - RESIDENCE

Case card format  
Each case appears inside a rounded, bordered card. No page break inside a card. Header line:  
Case {CaseNumber} | {MM/DD/YY HH:mm} | {IncidentType or Subtype} - {Statute}  
Bullets (include only relevant bullets per category):

*   Location: {FullAddress}{optional context in parentheses}
*   Grid/Zone: {Grid} / {Zone}
*   Parking Location: {ParkingLocation} \[MV Theft and Burglary - Auto only\]

    *   Total: ${LossTotal with commas and two decimals}
*   Status: {Status} (allow values like Active Investigation, Active/Administratively Closed, Cleared, Closed)

Sorting  
Within each section, sort cases oldest to newest by Incident Date & Time. Missing values  
If a field is blank, output “Data Incomplete.” Do not infer values. Money and dates  
Money uses commas and two decimals, for example $1,024.00. Dates in cards and table use MM/DD/YY HH:mm. Summary table  
Place the table after all sections. Include every case shown above. Columns:  
Case # | Type | Date/Time | Loss Total | Status  
Right-align money. Use “N/A” when a loss figure does not apply. Use $0.00 for zero. Footer  
Left: Hackensack Police Department — Strategic Crime Analysis Unit | Cycle: {CycleID}  
Right: Generated: {today’s date in MM/DD/YYYY}

## Response:
Thought for 5s

No. Remove the example block. If you leave it in, models often echo it into the output. That breaks the summary table. Add one of these lines instead:

*   “Do not echo any examples. Build the table from the CSV rows only.”
*   “Examples below are for reference only. Do not include them in the HTML output.”

If you must keep a visual reference, wrap it in HTML comments so it won’t print:

```html
<!-- EXAMPLE ONLY. DO NOT OUTPUT. ...example table markup here...
-->
```

Your drop-in prompt is complete without the example. ---
