# Chunk 8 Summary

However:
The files provided contain only summarized attendance data by training type, not course names or a log of distinct courses. If you're looking to extract a course catalog, we'd need a source that includes:
Officer(s) Attended
Examples of such sources:
A table of in-person/online/firearms courses logged individually (like the sample shown earlier). A worksheet that tracks each training entry (like: "ESU Tactical EMS", "Defensive Driving", etc.)
