# Project Description
Describe here in clear detail what the project or task is. Include objectives, scope, and any key requirements.

Example:
- Build a Python data analysis tool that ingests CSV files, cleans data, performs statistical analysis, and outputs summary reports.
- Modularize code into reusable components.
- Ensure code is well tested and documented.

# Instructions for Cursor AI
- Use this markdown file as the primary source of truth for the project requirements.
- Enable the multi-agent mode to run multiple AI agents in parallel to expedite coding, testing, and documentation.
- Manage agents autonomously: assign tasks such as coding modules, writing tests, and reviewing code to different agents.
- Update the `## Workflow State` section regularly with progress, decisions, and reasoning.

# File References
If applicable, include snippets or indicate important files and their locations here.
Provide file names and relevant content excerpts as needed.

# Workflow State
Track current status, agent activities, and task breakdown. Cursor will update this area.

- **Status:** Starting project
- **Active Agents:** Planning Agent, Coding Agent, Testing Agent, Documentation Agent
- **Next Steps:** 
  - Coding Agent to begin module 1 implementation
  - Testing Agent to prepare test cases skeleton
  - Planning Agent to schedule tasks for next iteration

# Reasoning and Notes
Use this section to explain any important design or implementation choices or constraints.
