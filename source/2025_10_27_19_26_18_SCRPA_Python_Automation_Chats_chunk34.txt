🧠 Note:
Replace YYYY-MM-DD in 7-Day and 28-Day with the correct dates from your current report cycle. Would you like these queries added directly to the script next? You said:
Let me confirm that they work prior to adding to the script
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely — smart move. Take your time testing each SQL query directly in ArcGIS Pro:

Open the layer properties. Go to the Definition Query tab. Paste the query and apply it. Ensure that:

Features appear on the map. The layer filters as expected. Once confirmed, just let me know — I’ll then update the Python script with the final, working queries. Provide Feedback | View Changes | Contribute. You said:
MV Theft 7-Day has a "The SQL expression has invalid syntax." ChatGPT said:
Thanks for testing — let’s fix that immediately. ✅ Here’s the likely issue:
ArcGIS SQL requires that string values be wrapped in single quotes, and the entire query must follow ArcGIS’s parser rules. Let’s fix the Motor Vehicle Theft 7-Day query:

🛠 Fixed Version:
calldate >= DATE '2024-04-25' AND calldate <= DATE '2024-05-01' AND 
disposition LIKE '%report%' AND 
calltype LIKE '%Motor Vehicle Theft%'
📌 If That Still Fails:
Try wrapping field names in double quotes:

"calldate" >= DATE '2024-04-25' AND "calldate" <= DATE '2024-05-01' AND 
"disposition" LIKE '%report%' AND 
"calltype" LIKE '%Motor Vehicle Theft%'
ArcGIS Online sometimes enforces quoted field names even when they contain no spaces. Try both variants — let me know which one works, and I’ll standardize the rest of the queries accordingly before we touch the script. You said:
 No errors with the first fixed version
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — thanks for confirming! We'll use the first fixed style (no double quotes around field names) for consistency across all queries. ✅ Action Plan:
I'll now rewrite all crime type queries in that exact working format. Once you finish testing the others manually, just let me know. Then I’ll embed them into your Python script and finalize it for automation. Let me know if you’d like me to queue up the fixed versions of the other 14 queries next. You said:
proceed

When you confirm these are all good, I’ll drop them into the updated Python script with the correct structure for each corresponding layer. Would you like the script update now, or continue testing any individual queries? You said:
All definitation queries were updated with the provided SQL and confirmed that all layers' source is the portal. What's next
ChatGPT said:
Excellent — since all queries are confirmed and layer sources are connected to the Portal, you’ve knocked out the hardest part! Here’s what’s next:

✅ Next Step: Final Script Update
I’ll now:

✅ Embed your confirmed definition queries directly into the automation script. ✅ Lock in the correct export path with the naming format:

C05W18_2025_05_06\Burglary_-_Auto_C05W18_2025_05_06.pdf
✅ Use proper map zooming and refresh logic. ✅ Ensure legend is populated with visible layers. 🧱 Before I Drop the Script:
Can you confirm these two quick items are correct:

🔠 Field Names:

calltype

disposition

calldate

📂 Final Export Folder:

C:\Users\carucci_r\OneDrive - City of Hackensack\_25_SCRPA\TIME_Based\Reports\C05W18_2025_05_06
If both are correct, I’ll push the final Python script for your toolbox tool. You said:
I have the attribute table open for the Sexual Offenses YTD. The heat map populated. advise and provide steps to get the Field Names
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — here’s how to get the exact field names for your Sexual Offenses YTD layer so we can 100% verify everything is in sync:

✅ Method 1: Use the Fields View (Recommended)
In the Contents pane, right-click the Sexual Offenses YTD layer. Go to Design > Fields (or just Fields depending on your ArcGIS Pro version). A new tab will open called Fields: Sexual Offenses YTD. In the table, find the column called Field Name — that's what your SQL and script must use. Scroll and look for the entries that match your field aliases:

“Call Type”

“Disposition”

“Call Date”

Copy the Field Name (not Alias Name) values and paste them here. ✅ Method 2: Hover in the Attribute Table (Quick)
Open the attribute table for Sexual Offenses YTD. Hover your mouse over the column headers (e.g., “Call Type”). A small tooltip should appear — it will display the actual field name. Once you paste those 3 field names here, I’ll finalize the script knowing it’s a perfect match for your hosted layer. Would you like a screenshot example of the Fields View as a reference? You said:
I right clicked the Field Name, selected copy but it will not past. should i type it in? I am worried of leading/trailing spaces
ChatGPT said:
Yes — it’s smart to be cautious, especially with leading/trailing spaces. Here’s a safer way:

✅ Use This Trick to Get Exact Field Names (No Typos)
In the Fields View, double-click the Field Name (not Alias). Hit Ctrl+C to copy. Open Notepad (or any plain text editor). Paste the field name into Notepad using Ctrl+V. This way:

You can see any hidden spaces. You’ll avoid accidentally copying the alias or header label. It ensures exact spelling and casing. Once pasted into Notepad, copy from there and paste here. If all 3 come through clean, I’ll wrap the script immediately. Let me know if you'd like me to wait while you do this. You said:

ChatGPT said:
Perfect — thank you for confirming. Based on the screenshots, the correct internal field names for the SQL definition queries are:

calldate for Call Date

disposition for Disposition

calltype for Call Type

You should use these internal names in your SQL expressions in the script and layer definition queries. For example, a corrected YTD query would look like this:

calldate >= date '2024-12-31' 
AND disposition LIKE '%report%' 
AND (
    calltype LIKE '%Vehicle Theft%' OR 
    calltype LIKE '%Commercial%' OR 
    calltype LIKE '%Residence%' OR 
    calltype LIKE '%Robbery%' OR 
    calltype LIKE '%Sexual%' OR 
    calltype LIKE '%Motor Vehicle Theft%'
)
Let’s move forward by applying this updated syntax to all relevant layers in your script. Do you want me to regenerate the SQL for all the crime types and sub-layers now using the corrected field names? You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Great — here are the updated SQL definition queries for each layer using the correct field names: calldate, disposition, and calltype. 🔹 Burglary - Auto
7-Day

calldate >= CURRENT_DATE - 7 
AND disposition LIKE '%report%' 
AND calltype LIKE '%Auto%'

Would you like these applied to the script or want to manually verify in ArcGIS Pro first? You said:
if you add it to the code would I have to manually update all the layers or will the code do it when it is run? ChatGPT said:
The code will automatically apply all the definition queries to the correct layers when it runs — no manual updates are needed in ArcGIS Pro each time. Here’s how that works:

The script uses the current reporting cycle dates from the Excel file. It builds SQL queries dynamically for each layer and time period (7-Day, 28-Day, YTD). Then it assigns those queries directly to the matching layers (e.g., MV Theft YTD, Robbery 28-Day, etc.). You just need to ensure the layer names in the map match the script exactly (they do right now). So once I add the updated SQL logic into the script, you’ll only need to:

Run the script. Get the updated layout exports — done! ✅ Ready for me to embed those updated SQL rules in the script now? You said:
ok lets update the code
ChatGPT said:
✅ The script has been updated to dynamically apply the correct SQL queries for all layers using field names from your hosted feature layer (calldate, disposition, calltype). It also generates a report folder named with the format: Report_Name_Submission_Date. 📝 When the script runs, it will:

Assign the appropriate filters to all layers automatically. Create the new folder. Export the layout PDFs to that folder. 📌 No manual layer updates are needed—this script handles everything when executed.

ChatGPT said:
Thanks for the update. The error is clear:

ValueError: Excel file format cannot be determined, you must specify an engine manually. 🔍 What this means:
pandas.read_excel() requires an engine (like openpyxl) to read .xlsx files in ArcGIS Pro’s Python environment, and that engine is not being automatically selected. ✅ Fix:
In your script, change the line:

cycle_df = pd.read_excel(csv_path)
to:

cycle_df = pd.read_excel(csv_path, engine='openpyxl')
📌 Next Step:
Once you make that change, save the script and re-run the tool. It should now read the Excel file without issue. Would you like me to walk you through updating the script file in ArcGIS Pro? Provide Feedback | View Changes | Contribute. You said:

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely — here’s a step-by-step guide to edit your script in ArcGIS Pro to fix the Excel engine error. 🛠 Step-by-Step: Edit Your Toolbox Script in ArcGIS Pro
1. Open the Toolbox
In the Catalog pane, go to your .tbx file (likely named CrimeAutomationTools.tbx). Expand it to show the script tool (probably WeeklyCrimeReport). Right-click on WeeklyCrimeReport, and select Edit. This opens the Python script in the ArcGIS Pro script editor. 2. Find This Line:
cycle_df = pd.read_excel(csv_path)
3. Replace It With:
cycle_df = pd.read_excel(csv_path, engine='openpyxl')
This tells pandas exactly which engine to use to read .xlsx files. 4. Save the Script
Click File > Save, or press Ctrl+S. 5. Re-run the Script Tool
Back in ArcGIS Pro, go to the Geoprocessing pane. Run the WeeklyCrimeReport tool again. Once you do that, the Excel read error should disappear. Let me know how it goes — if any other error appears, I’ll help you address it right away. Provide Feedback | View Changes | Contribute. You said:

ChatGPT said:
Thanks — this error confirms the issue:

zipfile.BadZipFile: File is not a zip file

🔍 What this means:
You're trying to read a CSV file using pd.read_excel() — but Excel readers only work with .xlsx or .xls formats, which are actually ZIP-based files. Since the file is really a .csv, we must use pd.read_csv() instead. ✅ Fix the Script Line
Change this line:

cycle_df = pd.read_excel(csv_path, engine='openpyxl')
To:

cycle_df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)
Once you make that one-line change in your script, save it and rerun the tool — it should work correctly and read the file with no errors. Let me know if you'd like me to walk through editing it again. You said:

Thanks — based on the exported PDFs you uploaded, here are the confirmed layout issues:

🔍 Layout Problems
🗺 Map is not visible:

Each PDF includes a legend and scale bar, but the map frame is empty — this means either:

No visible layers were drawn in the extent

Or the layout’s map frame is not linked properly to your map document

📏 Map extent is not zoomed:

There’s a fixed scale bar but no features showing, even though queries ran. 🧭 Legend shows only the title (no items):

The legend appears as a placeholder. Likely caused by either:

Layers not drawn

Layers hidden from the legend group

Legend not referencing active map frame properly

✅ Here's What to Check Next in the Template Project
Open the layout:

Go to the layout in your .aprx template project. Click the map frame on the layout. In the Layout tab or the Element Properties, confirm:

It is linked to the correct map (not some default or empty map). You should see “Map Frame: YourMapName”

Test layer visibility:

In the map view (not layout), turn on a layer manually (e.g., Robbery YTD) and zoom to it. Now go back to the layout — does the map frame update? If not, relink the map frame to the correct map. Inspect the Legend:

Click the legend in the layout. In the Contents pane, right-click → Properties. Ensure the legend is referencing the correct layers. Try deleting the legend and inserting a new one to auto-pick up visible layers. Would You Like Me To:

Thanks for sharing the exported layouts — I’ve reviewed the PDFs and here’s a breakdown of what’s happening:

❌ Observed Issues in All Layouts
🗺 No map content drawn

The layout shows a blank map frame — meaning no visible features or basemap are rendered. 📜 Legend is blank

Only the word "Legend" appears; no layer items are listed. This suggests:

Layers are either not drawing at export time, or

The legend is not linked to the layers currently visible in the map frame. 📐 Layout scale bar is present

This confirms the layout is functioning — just not drawing correct content. 🔍 Root Cause Likely
The map frame in the layout (Crime_Reporting_Layout) might not be:

Properly linked to the map object (map_obj = project.listMaps()[0])

Or the map frame doesn't redraw during script execution if it’s frozen or misaligned. ✅ Recommended Next Steps
🛠 Fix 1: Confirm Map Frame Link
Open your template project in ArcGIS Pro. Open the Crime_Reporting_Layout. Click on the map frame. In the Contents pane, ensure the map frame’s associated map is the correct one (with your analysis layers). You should see it listed as Map Frame: YourMapName in the Element Properties. If it says “Map Frame: Map1” or something unexpected, relink it to your actual map. 🛠 Fix 2: Confirm Legend Settings
Click the Legend item in the layout. Check Contents pane > Legend — it should list the layers.
