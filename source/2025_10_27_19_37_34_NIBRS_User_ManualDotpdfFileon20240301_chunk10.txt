Note: When more than three types of drugs are involved, the type of measurement for the two 
most important drugs (as determined by the reporting agency based on the quantity, value, and 
deadliness of the drugs/narcotics)  should be reported in Measurement Type 1 and

I
f there were three victims in an  incident,  the LEA should report victim information for each of 
the three victims —one with Victim Sequence Number 001, another with 002, and the last with 
003. So
me assault situations can pose difficulties in distinguishing victims. If a number of persons are 
involved in a disput e or disturbance and LE investigations cannot establish the aggressors from

occur with domestic disputes,  barroom brawls,  etc.) Data Element 24 (Victim Connected to UCR Offense Code)  
 
LEAs should use Data Element 24  to link each victim to the up to ten most serious (as 
determined by the reporting agency) Group A offenses that were perpetrated against him/her 
during the incident. Example  
 An offender robbed two victims, Victim 001 and Victim 002  and also raped Victim 001. In the 
victim information  for Victim 001, the agency should report both 120 (Robbery) and 11A (Rape). In the v ictim information  for Victim 002, the agency  should  submit only 120  (Robbery). Note : E ach offense may not affect e very victim in an incident. For each victim, report only 
those offenses affecting him/her. Note:   The robbery/assault example above contains “ lesser included” offenses. Mutually 
exclusive offenses are offenses that cannot occur to the same victim according to UCR 
Definitions. Lesser included offenses are offenses where one offense is an element of another 
offense and cannot be reported as having happened to the victim along with the other offense. (For more information abou t mutually exclusive/lesser included offenses, refer to the NIBRS 
Technical Specification, Data Element 24 [Victim Connected to UCR Offense Code]). Data Element 25 ( Type of Victim)  
 LEAs should use Data Element 25  to categorize each victim associated with a NIBRS incident. Valid Data Values  
 
LEAs should enter only one  per victim segment : 
 
B = Business  
F = Financial Institution  
G = Government  
I  = Individual  
L = Law Enforcement Officer (valid for offenses 09A, 13A, 13B, and 13C only)  
O = Other  
R = Religious Organization  
S = Society/Public  
U = Unknown

During a bank robbery, the offender pointed a gun at a teller , demanded, and received money. The robber also pistol -whipped a customer who stood in his way as he made his getaway from 
the bank. There were three victims:   the bank (F = Financial Institution), the teller  
(I = Individual), and the pistol -whipped customer (I = Individual). Therefore, agencies should 
enter the appropriate codes into their respective Victim Segments. Note:   When the type of victim is L = Law Enforcement Officer, agencies must report Data 
Elements 25A, 25B, and 25C. Agencies should report only the victim type of L = Law 
Enforcement Officer when an officer is the victim of a homicide or an assault. For other types of 
crimes (such as R obbery), the victim type should be I = Individual. 25A – 25C Law Enforc ement Officers Killed and Assaulted ( LEOKA ) 
 LEAs should use Data Elements 25A, 25B, and 25C to report line -of-duty felonious killings and 
assaults on sworn LEOs , who have full arrest powers . LEAs should report all assaults on officers , 
with or without injuries. Note:   In April 2015, the LEOKA Program included special role functions in its definition:  “An 
individual serving in the capacity of a LEO at the request of a LEA whose officers meet the 
current collection criteria. The individual must be under the supervision of a certified LEO from 
the requesting agency at the time of the incident but is not required to be in the physical 
presence of the o fficer while he/she is working an assigned duty.”  
 
Data Element 25A (Type of Officer Activity/Circumstance)  
 
Data Element 25A —Type of Officer Activity/Circumstance —describes  the type of activity that 
the officer was engaged at  the time he/she was  assaulte d or killed in the line of duty . Valid Data Values  
 
LEAs should enter only one  per victim segment : 
 01 = Responding to Disturbance Call ( family quarrels, person with firearm, etc.) 02 = Burglaries in Progress or Pursuing Burglary Suspects  
03 = Robberies in  Progress or Pursuing Robbery Suspects  
04 = Attempting Other Arrests  
05 = Civil Disorder ( riot, mass disobedience)  
06 = Handling, Transporting, Custody of Prisoners  
07 = Investigating Suspicious Persons or Circumstances  
08 = Ambush , No Warning

Data Element 25B (Officer Assignment Type)  
 
LEAs should use Data Element 25B —Officer  Assignment Type —to specify the officer’s type of 
assignment at the time he/she sustained injury or died while on duty . Code F (Two -Officer 
Vehicle) and codes G and H (One -Officer Vehicle  Alone and Assisted, respectively ) pertain to 
uniformed officers; codes I and J (Detective or Special Assignment  Alone and Assisted, 
respectively ) to non-uniformed officers; and codes K and L (Other  Alone and Assisted, 
respectively ) to officers assaulted or killed while in other capacities, such as foot patrol or off 
duty. The term assisted  refers to LE assistance only. Valid Data Values  
 
LEAs should enter only one  per victim segment : 
 For Uniformed Law Enforcement Officers:  
F = Two -Officer Vehicle  
G = One -Officer Vehicle (Alone)  
H = One -Officer Vehicle (Assisted)  
For Non -Uniformed Officers:  
I = Detective or Special Assignment (Alone)  
J = D etective or Special Assignment (Assisted)  
For Law Enforcement Officers Serving in Other Capacities (Foot patrol, Off duty, etc. ):  
K = Other (Alone)  
L = Other (Assisted)  
Note: The term “assisted” refers only to LE assistance. Example 1  
 
An agency dispatched a one-officer vehicle to the scene of a crime in progress. There were  no 
other units to back up the officer. The perpetrator , who had committed a Burglary, immediately 
fired on the officer upon his arrival at the scene . The agency should report  the incident as G = 
One-Officer (Alone). Example 2  
 An agency dispatched a one-officer vehicle to t he scene of a crime in progress. Another one -
officer vehicle answered  the call as well. While attempting to apprehend the individual, the 
perpetrator punched one of the officers. The agency should code the incident as  
H = One -Officer (Assisted). Data Element 25C (Officer – ORI Other Jurisdiction)  
 
An ORI is  the unique nine -character identifier that the NCIC has assigned to each agency. If a 
perpetrato r killed  or assault ed a LEO who was  on duty in a jurisdiction other than his /her  own, 
the LEA having jurisdiction  where the incident occurred  should report the LEO killed or 
 
Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         117  assaulted . The agency should use  Data Element 25C to identify the ORI of the LEO’s  agency. The 
agency does not need to enter information in this data element  if the officer is assaulted in 
his/her  own jurisdiction. Example  
 
On May 2, 201 5, a perpetrator shot LEO. The officer  was working in conjunction with a state 
narcotics task force  in a jurisdiction outside his own duty assignment while serving a warrant on 
an individual known to be operating a methamphetamine lab. In reporting the incident, the 
covering agency should use Data Element 25C ( Officer – ORI Other Jurisdiction) because the 
LEO was assaulted in the line of duty outside his regularly assigned jurisdiction. Data Element 26 (Age of Victim)  
 
Data Element 26 —Age of Victim —indicates  the age or age range of an individual (person) victim  
in an incident when the crime occurred. Valid Data Values  
 
01 – 98 = Years Old  
 
NN = Under 24 Hours  
NB = 1 – 6 Days Old  
BB = 7 – 364 Days Old  
99 = Over 98 Years Old  
00 = Unknown 
 Example 1  
 A 20 -year -old female told police she was a victim of R ape when she was 15 years old. The 
correct reported age value for Data Element 26 is 15 = 15 Years Old. Example 2  
 
If a deceased male victim appeared to be a teenager, agencies could report the Age of Victim  as 
13 to 19 (i.e., 1319). Note:  When the Victim is LEO, the only valid age r ange is 17 -98. Data Element 27 (Sex of Victim)

Data Element 29 —Ethnicity of Victim —indicates the ethnicity of an individual (person) victim in 
an incident. This is an optional data element . Valid Data Values  
 H = Hispanic or Latino  
N = Not Hispanic or Latino  
U = Unknown 
 
The ethnic designation of Hispanic or Latino  include s persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, 
Central or South American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. Data Element 30 (Resident Status of Victim)  
 If the victim type entered in Data Element 25 (Type of Victim) was I = Individual, LEAs  should 
enter  the person’s resident status (resident or nonresident) into Data Element  30 (Resident 
Status of Victim) . This is an optional data element . Note s:  Resident status does not refer to the immigration or national citizenship status of the 
individual. Instead, it identifies whether individuals are residents or nonresidents of the 
jurisdiction that the incident occurred. It also enables agencies hav ing a high transient 
population to show their population at risk is actually higher than their official resident 
population. A resident is a person who maintains his/her permanent home for legal purposes in the locality (town, city, or community) where the crime  took place. Reporting agencies should base their 
determinations of residency on the town, city, or community where the crime occurred rather than their broader geographical jurisdictions. In regard to  university/college campuses, only 
persons living on campus (in dormitories, etc.) would be considered residents if victimized 
within the confines of the school property; a campus LEA should report the crime. Valid Data Values  
 
N = Nonresident  
R = Resident  
U = Unknown 
 Example 1  
 A victim was robbed in San Diego, California, where he resides; the agency should enter   
R = Resident. Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         120  Example 2  
 
The victim of a crime was a business. Because the victim was not an individual, the agency 
shou ld not use this data element. Data Element 31 (Aggravated Assault/Homicide Circumstances)  
 Data Element 31  describe s the circumstances of either an Aggravated Assault or a Homicide . Therefore, LEAs should use  it only with offenses of 13A = Aggravated Assault and  
09A-09C = Homicide Offenses. LEAs should base s elections of circumstances on information known following their 
investigation, not decisions of a grand jury, coroner’s inquest, or other agency outside LE . LEAs 
should a lways select the most appropriate circumstances as determined by investigation. Traff ic fatalities, accidental deaths, or deaths of victims due to their own negligence are not to 
be included as N egligent Manslaughters. LEAs should report information regarding all other 
Negligent Manslaughters regardless of actions to prosecut e. 
 
As a result of the APB recommendation to collect Vehicular Manslaughter offenses under 
Negligent Manslaughter, the following statements will be effective beginning January 1, 2019. Traffic fatalities associated with driving under the influence, distracted driving (using a cell/smartphone, and reckless driving traffic fatalities are included as negligent manslaughters . Accidental traffic fatalities, accidental deaths  (not resulting from gross negligence) , or deaths of 
persons  due to their own negligence are not to be  included as Negligent Manslaughters. LEAs 
should report information regarding all other Negligent Manslaughters regardless of actions to prosecute. Note:   Data Element 06 now represents “Domestic Violence” data (see the definition of 
“Domestic and Family Violence” on page 188.) Valid Data Values  for 13A = Aggravated Assault and 09A = Murder and N on-Negligent

 As a result of the APB recommendation to collect Domestic Violence data, t he following  
definition will be effective on January 1, 2019. 06 Domestic and Family Violence 
 The use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force or a weapon; or the use of coercion or intimidation; or committing a crime against property by a current or former spouse, parent, 
or guardian of the victim; a person with whom the victim shares a child in common; a person 
who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim; a 
person who is cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian; or by a person who is or has been similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim. Example  
 
Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         122  Two juvenile street gangs fought  over “turf rights” to sell drugs  and a member of one gang  
killed a member of the other gang . Possible entries are 01 = Argument, 03 = Drug Dealing, and  
05 = Juvenile Gang. Even though all three would apply, there is a limit of two entries. Since the 
agency should report the two most descriptive data values , it should report 03 = Drug Dealing  
and 05 = Juvenile Gang. Example  
 
While  resisting  an arrest, a fugitive pulled a gun and fired twice in the direction of two police 
officers who were attempting to take the fugitive into custody. Neither officer sustained injury, 
but both drew their weapons and returned fire, killing the fugitive. Because this was a 
justifiable homicide,  the agency should enter  21 = Criminal Killed by P olice Officer. As a result of the APB recommendation to collect Domestic Violence data, the following two 
examples will be effective on January 1, 2019. Example  
 A police officer responded to a night time disturbance call at a single family residence. Upon arriving at the scene, the officer knocked on the door. The door is answered by a man and a woman. Over the course of several minutes of questioning, the officer learns the woma n is the 
renter of the home and the man is her ex -boyfriend. They had been arguing because the ex -
boyfriend wanted to take the victims lap top. When the victim s aid no,  the ex -boyfriend began 
throwing several objects around the house and ultimately struck the woman with a table lamp, 
causing severe lacerations. Because this incident is domestic related and the offense was aggravated assault, the agency shou ld ent er 06 = Domestic Violence  
 Example  
 A police officer responded to a report of gunshots at a convenience store. Upon arrival, the officer found a crowd in front of the convenience store. He then entered the store to find a male gunshot victim and the stor e clerk. The clerk reported the victim and a female entered 
the store and had an argument that lasted several minutes. The female then shot the victim with a handgun and fled the store. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene. The female was apprehended several hours later and identified as the victim’s wife. Because this incident is domestic related and the offense was murder, the agency should enter 06 = Domestic 
Violence. Data Element 32 (Additional Justifiable Homicide Circumstances)  
 Data Element  32—Additional Justifiable Homicide Circumstances —further describes the 
circumstances of a Justifiable Homicide , i.e., when an agency enters either 20 = Criminal Killed

fugitive. This was a J ustifiable Homicid e; the LEA should report the incident as 21 = Criminal 
Killed by Police Officer. Since  the agency can report only one A dditional Justifiable Homicide
