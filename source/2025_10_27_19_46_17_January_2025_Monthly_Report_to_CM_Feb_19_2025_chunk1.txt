III. Strategic Goals
Progress on Strategic Initiatives
Strategic Priority 1: The Continued Development of Robust Crime Reduction Capabilities
Progress: On track
Key Achievements: The Chief continues to dedicate significant attention aimed at developing location-based deployment resource deployment strategies and CompStat assessment capabilities. This month, the HPD hosted meetings at the Safe Street Operations Control Center with ESRI, LawSoft, Motorola Solutions, and the COPS Office to explore solutions for fully implementing these capabilities while addressing data constraints and access challenges. Strategic Priority 2: Community Engagement 
Progress: On track
Key Achievements: 
The Chief continues to collaborate with the COPS Office, exploring programs and training opportunities to strengthen HPD’s community engagement efforts. Additionally, HPD secured a competitive grant from the International Association of Chiefs of Police to enhance officer wellness, a critical initiative that ultimately supports stronger community engagement
In January, Chief Antista continued to utilize trained community engagement officers from across the department to support various outreach initiatives. In January 2025, the department took part in six citywide events and an additional 13 school-based events. Strategic Priority 3: Overtime Reduction Initiative 
Progress: On track
Key Achievements: 
Chief Antista remains committed to reducing overtime costs related to tour commander and communications unit vacancies. However, contractual obligations within PBA 9, PBA 9A, and the communication operators have presented challenges in managing overtime expenditures. IV. Challenges and Areas for Improvement
Internal Challenges
Leveraging Data for Analysis
The RMS system plays a vital role in the HPD’s future success. However, personnel using RMS data - whether directly or through related applications like mapping - continue to encounter geocoding errors and system limitations. Meetings with LawSoft have enabled progress in this area; however, it is likely that the HPD will continue to experience limitations in the future since we are demanding much from our data which exceeds expectations from area departments. As HPD seeks new technologies to enhance operations and efficiency, resolving RMS data management and access issues will be critical for future success. It’s also important to recognize that the future staffing of HPD’s Communications Unit is closely tied to this issue. If the City decides to outsource communications to Bergen County, it will be required to adopt a specific RMS, which also presents potential cost savings. Until a final decision is made, HPD’s ability to fully explore all RMS solutions remains limited. Staffing Communications: 
The HPD continues to struggle with staffing shortages in its Communications Unit, primarily due to recruitment challenges driven by non-competitive compensation and significant retention issues. As a result, like all of last year, this coming year, we will continue to see substantial overtime costs accrued monthly to cover shifts for both civilian dispatchers and sworn, radio-certified officers. Our 2024 cost assessment comparing the expenses of maintaining an in-house Communications Unit - including wages, pensions, Social Security costs, and overtime - versus outsourcing to Bergen County indicated that the City’s current staffing model is approximately $225 higher. Training and Development: 
The contractual obligations between the City and the PBA continue to hinder efforts to send Patrol Division personnel to training. These restrictions prevent schedule adjustments for non-mandatory elective training and development programs, limiting opportunities to enhance performance and career growth. As the COPS Office prepares to recommend leadership development training across all ranks, these contractual constraints will pose a challenge. Over time, the associated costs to pay overtime for officer training will make it increasingly difficult to provide officers with access to these training opportunities. V. Conclusion 
In summary, this monthly report offers a detailed snapshot of the HPD’s progress, challenges, and opportunities. It highlights areas where we are making significant strides, as well as those that still require focused attention. With a continued commitment to data-driven decision-making, efficient resource management, and proactive community engagement, the HPD remains on a strong path toward becoming a model law enforcement agency.
