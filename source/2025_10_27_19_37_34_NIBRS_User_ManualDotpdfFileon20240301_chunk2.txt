Normally, the offenses 
must have occurred during an unbroken time period  and at the same or adjoining location s. 
However, incidents can also be comprised of offenses which , by their nature , involve continuing 
criminal activity by the same offenders  at different times and places, as long as LE  deems the 
activity to constitute  a single criminal transaction. See Example 4, Same Time and Place. In SRS, LEAs  use the concept of Same Time and Place to determine whether they should apply 
the Hierarchy Rule  to a group of crimes; if so, the agency reports only the crime highest in the 
hierarchy. Though NIBRS does not follow the Hierarchy Rule, LEAs  mus t still apply the concept 
of Same Time and Place to determine whether a group of crimes constitute s a single incident. This is crucially  importan t since the application of the concept determines whether LEAs should 
report the crimes a s individual incidents  or as a single incident comprised of multiple offenses. Examples of Acting in Concert and  Same Time and Place  
 It is im possible to provide instructions to cover all situations, however, some examples are 
provided below. Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         12  Example 1, Acting in Concert  
 
During a R obbery in a bar, one offender began to rape a victim. The other offender told the  
rapist to stop and only rob the victim. In this example, there was only one incident with two 
offenses  (i.e., Robbery and R ape). Although the other robber did not consent to the  Rape, by 
displaying a gun he prevented someone from coming to the victim’s assistance and thereby assisted  in the commission of the crime. The LEA should report one incident with two offenses :   
One offender is connected to the victim through the offense of R obbery and R ape, and  the 
other is connected to the victim only through the offense of R obbery. Example 2, Acting in Concert  
 A domestic argument escalated from a shouting match between a husband and wife to an Aggravated Assault during which the husband began beating his  wife. The wife, in her own 
defense, shot and killed her husband. The responding officer submitted one incident report. The LEA should have reported this information via NIBRS as two separate incidents becau se the 
husband could not have been  acting in concert with the wife in his own killing. The LEA would 
submit  one incident involving the A ggravated Assault perpetrated by the husband and a second 
incident involving the killing. This would allow  the maintenance of the original incident number 
for record keeping purposes at the local level and simultaneously satisf y reporting 
requirements for NIBRS. Example 3, 
Acting in Concert  
 
Two
 offenders  robbed a bar, forcing the bartender to surrender money from the cash  register 
at gunpoint. The robbers also took money and jewelry from three customers. One of the 
robbers, in searching for more customers to rob, found a female customer in the rest room and raped her there without the knowledge  of the other offender. When the rapist returned, both 
robbers left. In this example, there were two incidents:   one involving Robbery and the other 
involving Rape, because the offenders were not acting in concert in both offenses. The LEA 
should report two incidents, each with one offense. Example 4
, Same Time and Place  
 Ov
er a period of 18 months, a computer programmer working for a bank manipulated the 
bank’s computer and systematically embezzled $70,000. The continuing criminal activity 
against the same victim  constituted a single incident involving the crime of E mbezzlement. 2.2 Classifying Offenses  
 For NIBRS, LEAs must report all  offenses within a particular crime. For example, an incident can 
include the crimes of R ape, Motor Vehicle Theft, and Kidnapping /Abduc tion. LEAs must ensure  
that each offense is reported as a separate, distinct crime and not just a part of another 
offense. For example, every Robbery includes some type of assault, but because the assault is 
an element integral to  the crime of Robbery, the LEA should report only Robbery. However, if 
 
Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         13  during a R obbery , the offender forces the victim to engage in sexual relations , then the LEA 
should report both Robbery and R ape, since  forced sexual intercourse is not an element of the 
crime of R obbery. Note:  The Robbery/assault example above contains “ lesser included ” offenses. Lesser included 
offenses are offenses where one offense is an element of another offense and cannot be 
reported as having happened to the victim along with the other offense. Mutually exclusive 
offenses are offenses that cannot occur to the same victim according to UCR Definitions . See 
the list of Offense Definitions  in section 2.4 for details . For example, a Murder and an 
Aggravated Assault ca nnot occur to the same victim. (For more information about mutually 
exclusive/lesser included offenses, refer to the NIBRS Technical Specification, Data Element 24  
[Victim Connected to UCR Offense Code ]). Note:  LE should classify and report offenses after they complete the preliminary investigation  
of a call for service or a complaint. Since identifying the crime problems faced by LE  is one of 
the objectives of NIBRS,  agencies  should re port  only offenses known to LE , not the findings of a 
court, coroner, jury, or prosecutor. Criteria for Distinguishing Between Group A and Group B Offenses  
 
When reporting data to the FBI ’s UCR Program via NIBRS, LE must also classify the offenses 
within an incident as Group A offenses or Group B offenses. Though some state and local RMSs  
require the same level of reporting for all offenses, NIBRS requires differing levels of detail in reporting Group A and Group B offenses. LE must report both incidents and arrests for Group A 
offenses, and they must report only arrests for Group B offenses. The Group A offenses are the 
more serious crimes such as Murder, Rape, Robbery, etc. Group B offenses tend to be minor in 
nature, such as C urfew/ Loitering/ Vagrancy Violations, Disorderly Conduct, Driving Under the 
Influence, etc. See the listing of Group A and Group B offenses in section 2.3 Group A and 
Group B offense listing. NIBRS contributors should use the following criteria to determine if a crime should be 
designated as a Group A o ffense:  
 
• The seriousness or significance of the offense. • The frequency or volume of its occurrence. • The prevalence of the offense nationwide. • The probability LE becomes aware  of the offense . • The likelihood LE is the best channel for collecting data regarding the offense. • The burden placed on LE in collecting data on the offense. • The national statistical validity and usefulness of the  data  collected. • The National UCR Program’s  responsibility to make crime data  available not only to LE but 
to others having a legitimate interest in it. Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         14  Additional Information Regarding  Classifying Offenses 
 
Traffic offenses (e.g., parking and moving violations) are not collected by the UCR Program except for D riving Under the Influence , Hit and R un (of a person), and V ehicular Manslaughter. Unless it is a component of a Group A offense  (e.g., Human Trafficking ) when an offense 
includes one of the Offenses of General Applicability  (i.e., words, phrases, or a similar variation 
thereof ), LEAs should report the offense as the Group B offense  90Z—All Other Offenses  if the 
substantive offense is a Group A offense. If it involves a Group B offense, LEAs should report the 
offense in the appropriate Group B category. The Offenses of General Applicability are Accessory Before/After the Fact, Aiding/Abetting, Conspiracy to Commit, Enticement, 
Facilitation of, Solicitation to Commit, Threat to Commit. LEAs should report attempted crimes the same as the substantive offense, with the data va lue 
A = Attempted in Data Element 7 (Offense Attempted/Completed). Agencies should report 
attempted murders as Aggravated Assaults, and all assaults should be reported as  
C = Completed. (Data elements  are data fields within each segment of the Group A Inc ident 
Report and in the Group B Arrest Report to describe the details of each component of a crime ; 
a data value  is a specific characteristic or type of field being reported that has an assigned 
code, e.g., M = Male or F = Female ). Example 1 
 
A
n LE
A arrest ed three members of a motorcycle gang for conspiracy to commit Murder. The 
LEA should submit three Group B Arrest Reports with the UCR Arrest Offense Code entered as  
90Z = All Other Offenses. Example 2 
 A
n LE
A arrest ed five liquor store owners for conspiring to avoid paying local liquor taxes. The 
LEA should submit f ive Group B Arrest Reports with the UCR Arrest Offense Code entered as  
90G = Liquor Law Violations. Example 3 
 A witness observed and scared away two unknown teenagers who were trying to set fire to an abandoned building. The LEA should submit a  Group A Incident Report that indicat ed the UCR 
Offense Code as 200  = Arson  and the offense was Attempted. Offense Categories – Crimes Against Persons, Property, and  Society  
 Each NIBRS offense belongs in  one of three categories:   Crime s Against Persons, Crime s Against 
Property, and Crime s Against Society. Crimes Against Person, e.g., Murder, Rape, and A ssault, 
 
Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         15  are those  offenses  whose victims are always individuals. The object  of Crimes Against Property, 
e.g., Robbery, Bribery, and B urglary, is to obtain money, property, or some other benefit. Crimes Against Society, e.g., A nimal Cruelty, Drug Violations, Gambling, and Prostitution,  
represent society’s prohibition against engaging in certain types of activity . For counting purposes, agencies should count one offense for each victim of a Crime Against 
Person, one offense for each distinct operation of a Crime Against Property (with the exception of Motor Vehicle Theft, where one offense is counted for each stolen vehicle), and one offense 
for each Crime Against Society. The listing s of the Group A and Group B offenses appear ing in this section indicate whether the 
offenses are Crime s Against Persons, Property, or Society. The Use of Offense Codes in NIBRS 
 
In NIBRS, there are 62 three -digit UCR offense codes ; one  for each of the 62 Group A and Group 
B offenses. The three- digit data values  are used to identify  the Group A and Group B offenses in 
an incident to submit NIBRS Group A Incident Reports and Group B Arrest Reports. Group A Offense Codes  
 
There are 24  Group A crime categories made up of 52  Group A offenses; therefore, there are 52 
Group A Offense Codes. The Group A Offense Codes, while unique to NIBRS, were generally 
derived from the four -digit NCIC Uniform Offense Classification Codes to facilitate interrelating 
offense data between the NCIC and the FBI’s UCR Program. NIBRS correlat es these data  using 
the first two characters  from the NCIC codes of certain o ffenses as the same first two 
characters of the UCR Offense Codes for respective offenses. The third character of the NIBRS  
Offense Code  is designated as either a zero (0) or an alpha character (A, B, C, etc.) to reference 
a subcategory of the crime catego ry. For example, the NCIC code for Simple Assault is 1313, 
whereas the NIBRS  Offense Code is 13B , e.g., 13B = Simple Assault . Exceptions  to the coding convention of Group A offenses are : 
 1. The NCIC Offense Code for Statutory Rape is 1116, whereas the NIBRS Offense Code is  
36B = Statutory Rape . 2. The NCIC Offense Code for Fondling (of child) is 3601, whereas the NIBRS Offense Code is 
11D = Fondling . Group B Offense Codes  
 NIBRS assigned a separate numbering series to the 1 0 Group B crime categories cons isting of 1 0 
Group B offenses. The  numbering series used 90 for the first two characters of each Group B 
offense and designated an alpha character for the third position. For example, the NCIC Offense 
Code for Bad Checks is 2606, whereas the NIBRS  Offense Code is 90A. Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         16  2.3 Group A and Group B Offense Listing  
 
There are 24  Group A offense categories made  up of 52 Group A offenses. The crime categories 
are listed below in alphabetical order. Additionally, each offense’s corresponding NIBRS  Offense 
Code follows  its name. Immediately following the code for  each offense name is an indication 
of whether it is  a Crime Against Person, Crime Against Pro perty, or Crime Against Society. In 
addition, the listing provides the NCIC Offense Code (when applicable). Group A O ffenses

2.4 Offense Definitions  
 Source of Offense Definitions  
 The use of standardized definitions in NIBRS is essential to the maintenance of uniform and  
 
Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         20  consistent data. This practice ensures the National UCR Program  considers and appropriately  
counts all criminal offenses of law, regardless of their different titles under state and local law 
or United States titles and s tatutes. The purpose of the FBI’s UCR Program is to provide a common language transcend ing the  
varying local and state laws. Therefore, the Program  did not intend for LEAs to use NIBRS 
offense definitions for charging persons with crimes. Instead, LEAs should use the definitions as 
a way  to translate crime into the common UCR language used throughout the United States. Though state statutes specifically define crimes so persons  facing prosecution will know the 
exact charges placed against them, the definitions used in NIBRS must be generic to  not exclude 
varying state statutes relating to the same type of crime. The Program  based NIBRS offense definitions on the common- law def initions found in Black’s 
Law Dictionary , as well as those used in  the NCIC 2000 Uniform Offense Classifications . Due to 
most state s bas ing their  statutes on the common -law definitions, even though they may vary as 
to specifics, these definitions  should fi t into the corresponding NIBRS offense classifications. S
tate  Offenses  
 
I
f a state statute for an offense includes additional offenses not fitting the NIBRS offense 
definition, the LEA should report the nonconforming offenses according to its  NIBRS offense 
classifications. For example, some states  worded their larceny statutes so broadly as to include 
the crime of Embezzlement. If an offender perpetrates E mbezzlement within such a state, LE  
should report the offense via NIBRS as Embezzlement, not Larceny /Theft. Certainly, unusual situations will arise in classifying offenses, and this manual cannot cover all 
circumstances. In classifying unusual situations, LE should consider the nature of the crime 
along with the guidelines provided. In addition to the Group A and Group B offense definitions 
and explanations, the Offense Lookup Table  at the end of this section will also aid in classifying 
offenses. If LEAs have concerns on how to classify an offense the y can contact the National UCR 
Program Office. G
roup A Offenses  
 T
here are 24  Group A offense  categories made up of 52  Group A offenses. The offense  
categories listed  below are in alphabetical order. Most  entries  include the following 
information:  
 
• NIBRS  offense code, offense name  
• Definition  
• Considerations and examples (as appropriate)  
 
 
Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         21  720 Animal Cruelty  
 
Inte
nti
onally, knowingly, or recklessly taking an action that mistreats or kills any animal 
without just cause, such as torturing, tormenting, mutilati on, maiming, poisoning, or 
abandonment. Included are instances of duty to provide care, e.g., shelter, food, water, care if sick or injured; transporting or confining an animal in a manner likely to cause injury or death; causing an 
animal to fight with another; inflicting excessive or repeated unnecessary pain or suffering, e.g., 
uses objects to beat or injure an animal. This definition does not include proper maintenance of 
animals for show or sport; use of animals for food, lawful hunting, fishing or trapping. For Animal Cruelty offenses, reporting agencies must enter at least one but no more than three types of activity (simple/gross neglect, organized abuse, intentional abuse or torture, or animal sexual abuse) in Data Element 12  (Type Criminal Activity/Gang Information). 200 Arson  
 To unlawfully and intentionally damage or attempt to damage any real or personal property by fire or incendiary device 
 An LEA should report only fires determined through investigation to have been unlawfully and 
intentionally set. Though the agency should include attempts to burn, it should not include fires 
of suspicious or unknown origin. In addition, an agency should report one incident for each 
distinct Arson operation originating within its jurisdiction. If a fire started by A rson in one 
jurisdiction spreads to another jurisdiction and destroys property, the LEA in which the fire 
started should report the incident and all dollar value damage . If a fire marshal collects A rson -related incident information, the LEA having jurisdiction should 
gather the information from the fire marshal and report it with their monthly submission  
(unless the Fire Marshall has a valid UCR ORI) . The National UCR Program  excludes Arson -
related deaths and injuries of po lice officers and firefighters, unless determined as willful 
Murders or assaults , due to the hazardous nature of these professions. LEAs should report t he type of property burned into Data Element 15 (Property Description)  
and the value of property burned  in Data Element 16 (Value of Property), which include s 
incidental damage resulting from fighting the fire. 13A − 13C Assault Offenses 
 An unlawful attack by one person upon another  
 Careful consideration of the following factors should assist in classify ing assaults:  
 
1. The type of weapon employed or the use of an object as a weapon. Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         22  2. The seriousness of the injury . 3. The intent and capability of the as sailant to cause serious injury . The weapons used or the extent of the injury sustained typically will be the  deciding factors in 
distinguishing Aggravated from S imple Assault. A weapon can be a gun,  knife or anything that 
could be used to harm someone else (a broken glass bottle, rocks, a shoe, etc.) In only a very 
limited number of instances should it be necess ary to examine the intent and capability of the 
assailant. The p rosecuti on policies  in a jurisdiction should not influence classification or 
reporting of LE offense data. Reporting agencies should examine and classify the assaults in 
their respective jurisdictions according to the standard UCR definitions, regardless of whether the offenses are termed misdemeanors or felonies by local definitions. By definition there can be no attempted assaults, only completed  assaults. Therefore, reporting 
agencies must enter the data value of C  = Completed for all Assault Offenses into D ata Element 7 
(Offense Attempted/Completed). 13A Aggravated Assault  
 An unlawful attack by one person upon another wherein the offender uses a weapon or displays it in a threatening manner, or the victim suffers obvious severe or aggravated bodily injury involving apparent broken bones, loss of teeth, possible internal injury, sev ere 
laceration, or loss of consciousness  
 In the definition above, a weapon is a commonly known weapon (a gun, knife, club, etc.) or any other item becoming one, although not usually thought of as a weapon, when used in a manner which could cause the types of severe bodily injury described. Note:   NIBRS considers mace and pepper spray to be weapons. A severe laceration is one that 
should receive medical attention. A loss of consciousness must be the direct result of force 
inflicted on the victim by the offender. Aggravated Assault includes assault with disease (as in cases when the offender is aware he/she 
is infected with a deadly disease and deliberately attempts to inflict the disease by biting, spitting, etc. ), assaults or attempts to kill or murder, poisoning, assault with a dangerous or deadly weapon, maiming, mayhem, and assault with explosives. In addition, this offense usually 
includes offenses such as p ointing and presenting a firearm, brandishing a firearm, etc. Though 
an agency may, on occasion, charge assailants with assault and battery or Simple Assault when 
an offender uses a knife, gun, or other weapon in the incident, the agency should classify this
