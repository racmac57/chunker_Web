The root cause is here:

Table.ColumnNames(SampleTable)
If SampleTable is still a function (instead of a table), calling Table.ColumnNames on it throws the error:

"1 arguments were passed to a function which expects 0"

✅ Fix Plan
We will ensure that SampleRow[Transform File] is evaluated (i.e. the function is executed), not just referenced. ✅ Final Working Fix:
Update your code like this:

let
    Source = Folder.Files("C:\\Users\\carucci_r\\OneDrive - City of Hackensack\\Documents\\Projects\\T4_New\\Lawsoft_Exports\\CAD_T4"),
    #"Filtered Hidden Files1" = Table.SelectRows(Source, each [Attributes]?[Hidden]? <> true),
    #"Invoke Custom Function1" = Table.AddColumn(#"Filtered Hidden Files1", "Transform File", each #"Transform File"([Content])),
    #"Renamed Columns1" = Table.RenameColumns(#"Invoke Custom Function1", {{"Name", "Source.Name"}}),
    #"Removed Other Columns1" = Table.SelectColumns(#"Renamed Columns1", {"Source.Name", "Transform File"}),

    // ✅ Ensure we execute the function and get a real table
    SampleRow = try #"Removed Other Columns1"{0} otherwise null,
    SampleTable = if SampleRow <> null then try SampleRow[Transform File] otherwise #table({}, {}) else #table({}, {}),

    #"Expanded Table Column1" = Table.ExpandTableColumn(#"Removed Other Columns1", "Transform File", Table.ColumnNames(SampleTable)),
    #"Changed Type" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#"Expanded Table Column1",{
        {"Source.Name", type text}
    })
in
    #"Changed Type"

ChatGPT said:
The persistent error:

Expression.Error: 1 arguments were passed to a function which expects 0. Details: Pattern= Arguments=[List]
means that SampleRow[Transform File] is still referencing the function, not the evaluated table. ✅ FIX: explicitly invoke the function again
Replace:

SampleTable = if SampleRow <> null then SampleRow[Transform File] else #table({}, {}),
With:

SampleTable = if SampleRow <> null then SampleRow[Transform File]() else #table({}, {}),
The key is the () — it executes the function stored in Transform File. ✅ Final Corrected Code
let
    Source = Folder.Files("C:\\Users\\carucci_r\\OneDrive - City of Hackensack\\Documents\\Projects\\T4_New\\Lawsoft_Exports\\CAD_T4"),
    #"Filtered Hidden Files1" = Table.SelectRows(Source, each [Attributes]?[Hidden]? <> true),

🔍 Line 8 — Issue

SampleTable = if SampleRow <> null then try SampleRow["Transform File"]() otherwise #table({}, {}) else #table({}, {}),
❌ Problem:
Power Query does not support ["Transform File"]() syntax for invoking functions stored in records — instead, you need to use dot notation:

SampleRow[Transform File]()
✅ Fix Line 8:
Replace line 8 with:

which option will fix this error? ChatGPT said:
The current error:

Expression.Error: 1 arguments were passed to a function which expects 0. 🔍 Root Cause
Record.Field(SampleRow, "Transform File") returns a function, not a table. You're not executing that function — and Table.ColumnNames(...) is trying to treat the function as a table. ✅ Correct Fix
You must invoke the Transform File function manually like this:

SampleTable = 
    if SampleRow <> null then 
        try SampleRow[Transform File]([Content]) 
        otherwise #table({}, {}) 
    else 
        #table({}, {}),
🔄 Change Needed in Canvas
Replace line 7 with:

SampleTable = if SampleRow <> null then try SampleRow[Transform File](SampleRow[Content]) otherwise #table({}, {}) else #table({}, {}),
This explicitly calls the function stored in Transform File with the file's Content. Would you like me to apply this fix directly? a. Yes, update line 7 to execute the transform

ChatGPT said:
Thanks — now that I see the full context in canvas, here’s the precise root issue:

SampleRow[Transform File](SampleRow[Content])
This causes the error:

"1 arguments were passed to a function which expects 0"

✅ Why? The "Transform File" function was already invoked in step:

#"Invoke Custom Function1" = Table.AddColumn(... each #"Transform File"([Content]))
So:

SampleRow[Transform File]
is already the result — a table, not a function anymore. ✅ Final Fix:
Simply reference the output directly — remove the function call (). Replace line 7 with:

SampleTable = if SampleRow <> null then try SampleRow[Transform File] otherwise #table({}, {}) else #table({}, {}),
Would you like me to apply this in your canvas now? a. Yes, update it and proceed
b. Also list all column names in SampleTable for preview

ChatGPT said:
You're still getting this error:

Expression.Error: 1 arguments were passed to a function which expects 0. 🔍 Root Cause (based on your current code):
Your function "Transform File" is expected to be a table after it's invoked here:

#"Invoke Custom Function1" = Table.AddColumn(..., each #"Transform File"([Content]))
But you're invoking "Transform File" manually again in:

SampleTable = if SampleRow <> null then try SampleRow[Transform File] otherwise #table({}, {}) else #table({}, {}),
Then this breaks:

Table.ColumnNames(SampleTable)
If SampleRow[Transform File] is still a function, then this breaks. If it’s already a table, you're fine. BUT... depending on how #"Transform File" is declared (likely in another query), it might still return a function! ✅ Bulletproof Fix:
Update the logic to always force the table extraction safely:

SampleTable = 
    if SampleRow <> null then 
        try 
            let fx = SampleRow[Transform File] in 
                if Value.Is(fx, type function) then fx() else fx 
        otherwise #table({}, {}) 
    else #table({}, {}),
Would you like me to apply this resilient fix to your canvas? a. Yes, update SampleTable with this safe check
b. Also preview the column names from SampleTable

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
✅ Updated: SampleTable now includes a safe type check — if Transform File is a function, it's invoked; otherwise it's used directly. a. Want to inspect and list the column names in the resolved SampleTable? b. Ready to apply filters or transformations to the expanded CAD data? You said:

🔍 The persistent error:

Expression.Error: 1 arguments were passed to a function which expects 0. Details: Pattern= Arguments=[List]
still happens because of this line:

#"Transform File"([Content])
in:

#"Invoke Custom Function1" = Table.AddColumn(#"Filtered Hidden Files1", "Transform File", each #"Transform File"([Content])),
✅ Correct Diagnosis
The query "Transform File" is defined as a query with zero parameters, but you're passing [Content] to it.
