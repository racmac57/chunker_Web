plants, trees, fountains, bird baths, etc. 69 = Logging Equipment  equipment specifically used by logging 
industry personnel during the perform ance 
of their duties; choker cables, binders, blocks, etc. Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         104  Data Value  Data Value Includes

74 = Photographic/Optical Equipment  equipment used to take photographs and/or 
relating to the science of optics or optical equipment; cameras, camcorders, telescopes, lenses, prisms, optical scanners, binoculars, monoculars, etc. Note:   This data value does not include 
camera phones. LEAs should classify these 
as 75 = Portable Electro nic Communications. 75 = Portable Electronic Communications  electronic devices used to communicate 
audible or visual messages; cell phones, camera phones, pagers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), BlackBerrys®, Gameboy®, iPads®, iPods®, Kindles®, Nooks®, etc. 76 = Recreational/Sports Equipment  equipment and materials used for 
recreational purposes, or during sports activities; skis, balls, gloves, weights, nets, bats, rackets, team uniforms, etc. Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         105  Data Value  Data Value Includes

descriptions of the data values identified  
 
78 = Trailers  transportation devices designed to be 
hauled by a motor vehicle; truck trailers,

Note:   This data value does not include 
accessories for water sports. LEAs should 
classify these as 76 = Recreational/Sports 
Equipme nt. 80 = Weapons – Other  weapons not classified under other 
categories; knives, swords, nunchakus, brass knuckles, crossbows, bows and arrows, pepper spray, tasers, sling shots, “BB” guns, pellet guns, gas -powered guns, paintball 
guns, etc. 88 = Pendi ng Inventory  items whose property description is 
unknown until the LEA conducts an inventory  
 
 Example 1  
 If a house was destroyed by A rson and the homeowners were away on an overseas trip , making 
it impossible to determine the property loss until their return,  the agency should enter   
88 = Pending Inventory. Note:   LEAs should update the property information with entries describing the type(s) of 
burned property when the results of the inventory are subsequently determined. Example 2  
 The following property was stolen as the result of a B urglary:   (1) a $10,000 stamp collection,  
(2) jewelry worth $5,000, (3) an $1,800 personal computer, (4) clothes worth $1,500,  
 
Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         106  (5) silverware worth $800,  (6) a $650 TV, (7) $450 in stereo equipment, (8) a $400 microwave 
oven, (9) $350 in cash, (10) a $250 copier (11) a $150 shotgun, (12) a $100 bicycle, (13) two 
credit cards (no value), and (14) ten blank personal checks (no value). The stamp collection should be coded as 46 = Collections/Collectibles . The jewelry and 
silverware should be entered as code 17  = Jewelry/Precious Metals/Gems , the personal 
computer as 07  = Computer Hardware/Software , the clothes as 06  = Clothes/Furs , the TV and 
stereo equipment as 26 = Radios/TVs/VCRs/DVD Players , the microwave oven as  
16 = Household Goods , the cash as 20  = Money , the copier as 23  = Office -type Equipment , and 
the shotgun as 13  = Firearms . Because more than ten items were taken, the bicycle, the two 
credit cards, and the ten blank personal checks should be coded as 77 = Other. Data Element 16 (Value of Property)  
 Agencies  should use Data Element 16 (Value of Property)  to enter the total dollar value (in 
whole dollars) of the property  burned (including  damage caused in fighting the fire), 
counterfeited, destroyed/damaged/vandalized, recovered, seized, stolen, etc., as a result of an  
incident. LEAs can enter u p to ten values to match the up to ten property descriptions (Data Element 1 5) 
associated with each Property Segment (i.e., each type of property loss/etc.) in the incident. If 
more than ten types of property are involved, the values of the nine most valuable, coded 
properties should be entered; then, the total value of the remaining properties combined which were coded as 77 = Other in Data Element 15 should be combined and then entered. If the value of a property is unknown, the agency should enter the value one dollar ($1) , which 
means unknown. An agency should report only th e value of the property stolen in its jurisdiction. Likewise, the 
agency that originally reported the property stolen should report the value of the property as 
recovered, regardless of whether another agency  recovered the property. This procedure 
applies to all stolen property, including motor vehicles. (Some agencies find it valuable to 
maintain separate records on property they recover for other jurisdictions.) The valid data values to be used in Data Element 16 (Value of Property) are 1 – 999,999,999;  
1 = Unknown , i.e., 000000001, shou ld be entered . Additional Considerations  
 When LEAs seize drugs or narcotics in a drug case, they should report no value for this data 
element, but should report the estimated quantity of the drugs/narcotics. Therefore, when the 
offense is 35A = Drug/Narcotic Violations, the data value of 6 = Seized should be entered into 
Data Element 14 (Type Property Loss/Etc.) and 10 = Drugs/Narcotics should be entered into Data Element 15 (Property Description). The agency should enter no value into this data 
 
Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         107  element; instead, agencies should use Data Element 20 (Suspected Drug Type), Data Element 
21 (Estimated Drug Quantity), and Data Element 22 (Type Drug Measurement). When drugs or narcotics are involved in other types o f crime (e.g., they were stolen through 
burglary, robbery, theft, etc., or destroyed by arson) their value should be entered into this data element, and Data Elements 20, 21, and 22 should be left blank. Gui
delines for Property Valuation  
 Q
uestions frequently arise as to how to valuate property involved in a criminal incident. The 
National UCR Program suggests the following guidelines:  
 
1. Round values to the nearest whole dollar. 2. U
se the fair market value for articles subject to depreciation because of wear and tear, age, 
or other factors caus ing the value to decrease with use. 3. U
se the victim’s valuation (in most instances) of items such as jewelry, watches, and other 
similar goods that decrease in value slightly or not at all with use or age. 4. Us
e replacement cost or actual cash cost to victim for new or almost new clothes, auto 
accessories, bicycles, etc. 5. U
se the current market price at the time of the theft, seizure, etc. for negotiable 
instruments such as bonds payable to the bearer, etc. 6. Sc
ore the theft of non -negotiable instruments such as traveler’s checks, personal checks, 
money orders, stocks, bonds, food stamps, etc., but do not record a value. 7. U
se the cost to the merchant (wholesale cost) of goods recovered, seized, stolen, etc., from 
retail establishments, warehouses, etc. In other words, use the dollar value representing 
the actual cash loss to the victim without any markup or profit added. 8. W
hen the victim obviously exaggerates the value of stolen/destroyed/damaged property 
for insura nce or other purposes, LEAs  should use common sense and good judgment to 
determine the value reported for  the stolen items. 9. O
ften the condition of the property is different at recovery than it was when stolen. LEAs 
should use t he market value at the time  of recovery even though it is less than the value 
reported at the time of the theft. If the value has increased by the time LE recovers the 
property, the recovery value should not exceed its initial stolen value . Hair- splitting 
refinements are unnecessary . Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         108  Note:   LEAs can use any type of resource to determine the value of property including the 
Internet, Craigslist, eBay, Kelley Blue Book, etc. Example 1  
 Two bicycles belonging to two victims were  stolen at the same time and place —one was worth 
$300 and the other $150. The agency should enter a  data value of 04 = Bicycles Data Element 
15 (Property Description) and the total value of the bicycles, 450 ($300 + $150 = $450) into Data 
Element 16 (Value  of Property). Example 2  
 
The following property was stolen as the result of a burglary:   (1) a $10,000 stamp collection,  
(2) jewelry worth $5,000, (3) an $1,800 personal computer, (4) clothes worth $1,500,  
(5) silverware worth $800, (6) a $650 TV, (7) $450 in stereo equipment, (8) a $400 microwave oven, (9) $350 in cash, (10) a $250 copier (11) a $150 shotgun, (12) a $100 bicycle, (13) two credit cards (no value), and (14) ten blank personal checks (no value). The values for each specifically coded pr operty should be:   $10,000 for data value  46 (the stamp 
collection), $5,800 for data value  17 (the jewelry and silverware), $1,800 for data value  07 (the 
personal computer), $1,500 for data value  06 (the clothes), $1,100 for data value  26 (the TV 
and stereo equipment), $400 for data value  16 (the microwave oven), $350 for data value  20 
(the cash), $250 for data value  23 (the copier), and $150 for data value  13 (the shotgun). Because more than ten items were taken, the value of the bicycle, the two credit c ards, and the 
ten blank personal checks should be combined and their value ($100) entered under data value 
77 = Other . Data Element 17 (Date Recovered)  
 If an LEA recovers property  previously stolen in their jurisdiction , they should report the month, 
day, and year of its recovery in Data Element  17. Accordingly, this data element should be used 
only if data value  5 = Recovered is entered into Data Element 14 (Type Property Loss/Etc.) . If 
the recovery date is unknown, enter the date of the re port. LEAs can report u p to ten dates of recovery to match each of the up to ten property 
descriptions associated with each type of property loss/etc. in the incident. If there is more 
than one date of recovery for the same Property Description, the agency should report the 
earliest date. Note:   LEAs should report r ecovered property only if they also first reported the property 
stolen . Example  
 
 
Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         109  On March 28, 201 7, a thief stole three cars from a used car lot. An LEA recovered o ne of the  
cars on April 1, 201 7. On April 24, 201 7, they recovered a second car. The date reported for this 
data element should be 2017 0401. Data Element 18 (Number of Stolen Motor Vehicles)  
 LEAs should use Data Element 18  to report the number of motor vehicles that were  stolen in a 
Motor Vehicle Theft incident. Therefore,  agencies should use this data element only  if the 
offense is 240 = Motor Vehicle Theft, 7 = Stolen was entered into Data Element 14 (Type 
Property Loss/Etc. ), and 03 = Automobiles, 05 = Buses, 24 = Other Motor Vehicles, 28 = Recreational Vehicles, or 37 = Trucks was entered into Data Element 15 (Property Description). If the number of vehicles stolen is unknown, the agency should enter 00 = Unknown. LEAs 
should not report m otor vehicles taken as the proc eeds of other offenses  (i.e., Burglary, Fraud, 
Embezzlement, etc. ). In NIBRS, agencies can report u p to 99 vehicles stolen per incident. Data Element 19 (Number of Recovered Motor Vehicles)  
 
Data Element 19  indicates how many motor vehicles an LEA recovered in a motor vehicle theft 
incident. Agencies shoul d use this data element only  if the offense is 240  = Motor Vehicle Theft, 
5 = Recovered was entered into Data Element 14 (Type Property Loss/Etc. ), and  
03 = Automobiles, 05 = Buses, 24 = Other Motor Vehicles,  28 = Recreational Vehicles, or  
37 = Trucks was entered into Data Element 15 (Property Description). If the number of 
recovered vehicles is unknown, the agency should report  00 = Unknown. The agency should not 
report m otor vehicles recovered as the proceeds of other offenses, i.e., Burglary, Fraud, 
Embezzlement, etc. In NIBRS, agencies can report up to 99 vehicles recovered per incident. Data Element 20 (Suspected Drug Type)  
 Data Element 20  identifies  the types of drugs or narcotics the LEA s eized in a drug case. Agencies should use this data element in the following two instances:  (1) one of the offenses in 
the incident was 35A = Drug/Narcotic Violations,  6 = Seized was entered into Data Element 14 
(Type Property Loss/Etc. ), and data value  10 = Drugs/Narcotics was entered into Data Element 
15 (Property Description) ; or (2) one of the offenses is   35A = Drug/Narcotic Violations and  
1 = None is entered in Data Element 14 (Type Property Loss/Etc.). This applies to drugs the 
offenders flushed dow n a toilet, swallowed, or the LEA used as part of an undercover 
investigation. LEAs can report up to three types of drugs/narcotics  per incident. If more than three are 
involved, the two most important (as determined by the reporting agency taking into ac count 
the quantity, value, and deadliness of the drugs/narcotics) should be reported under their applicable drug types and the remaining drugs/narcotics should be entered as a single  
X = Over 3 Drug Types entry. LEAs should not use this data element when  they find drugs or narcotics burned, stolen, etc., in 
connection with other offenses, such as a rson, burglary/ breaking and entering , or l arceny/ theft. Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         110  Valid Data Values  
 
LEAs should enter up to three  drug types per incident: 
 A = Crack Cocaine  
B = Cocaine (all forms except Crack)  
C = Hashish  
D = Heroin  
E = Marijuana  
F = Morphine  
G = Opium  
H = Other Narcotics:   Codeine; Demerol; Dihydromorphinone or Dilaudid; Hydrocodone or 
Percodan; Methadone; Pentazocine; Propoxyphene or Darvon; etc. I = LSD J = PCP 
K = Other Hallucinogens:   BMDA or White Acid; DMT; MDA; MDMA; Mescaline or Peyote; 
Psilocybin; STP; Spice; Dronabinol or Marinol; etc. L = Amphetamines/Methamphetamines (includes Methcathinone)  
M = Other Stimulants:   Adipex, Fastine, and Ionamin (Derivat ives of Phentermine); Benzedrine; 
Didrex; Khat; Bath Salts; Methylphenidate or Ritalin; Phenmetrazine or Preludin; Tenuate; etc. N = Barbiturates  
O = Other Depressants:   Glutethimide or Doriden, Methaqualone or Quaalude, or Talwin ; etc. P = Other Drugs:   Antidepressants (Elavil, Triavil, Tofranil, etc. ); Aromatic Hydrocarbons; 
Tranquilizers (Chlordiazepoxide or Librium, Diazepam or Valium, etc. ); Steroids; etc. U = Unknown Type Drug  
X = Over 3 Drug Types  
 
Note:   Only agencies in jurisdictions where the possession of Spice, also known as K2, is illegal 
should report offenses and/or arrests for the drug. Spice is a synthetic, cannabinoid herbal 
substance that, when smoked, produces a Marijuana- like high. However, agencies should not 
classify Spice as M arijuana for crime reporting purposes. Because it has been known to cause 
hallucinations in some users, the  Chemical Unit at the  FBI’s Laboratory has advised  that 
agencies should report the drugs as  K = Other Hallucinogens. Example  
 In a drug case, an LEA se ized the following drugs:   (1) 1.5 kilograms of C rack, (2) 2.125 pounds 
of Marijuana, (3) 2.0 liquid ounces of Morphine, and (4) 500 Valium capsules. The agency 
should enter A = Crack Cocaine, E = Marijuana, and X = Over 3 Drug Types as a single entry for the Morphine and V alium because more than three types of drugs were seized. Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         111  Note:  When more than three types of drugs are involved, the two most important drugs (as 
determined by the reporting agency based on the quantity, value, and deadliness of the 
drugs/narcotics) should be reported in Drug Type 1 and Drug Type 2; X = Over 3 Drug Types 
should be entered in Drug Type 3. D
ata Element 21 (Estimated Drug Quantity)  
 
L
EAs sh ould use Data Element 21  to indicate the quantity of drugs or narcotics seized in a drug 
case. Therefore, LEAs should use it only if one of the offenses in the incident was  
35A = Drug/Narcotic Violations, 6 = Seized was entered into Data Element 14 (Type Property 
Loss/  Etc. ), and 10 = Drugs/Narcotics was entered into Data Element 15 (P roperty Description). The NIBRS Technical Specification indicates nine characters are available to enter the number of 
whole pounds, ounces, grams, etc., and three more characters are available to enter the decimal amount  (i.e., the qua ntity expressed in  thousandths ). Because the decimal is implied, 
agencies should not enter a decimal point into Da ta Element 21 . LEAs should enter trace 
amounts of a drug as “000000000001” in this data element. If the substance was sent to a laboratory for analysis, and a response has not yet been received, 
then 1 = None (i.e., 0000000010 00) must be entered into Data Element 21 to indicate None. LEAs must update this  interim report  with the true quantity once the response arrives. LEAs can enter u p to three quantities  to m atch the up- to-three drug types reported  in Data 
Element 20 (Suspected Drug Type). If more than three drugs or narcotics are involved, the 
quantities of the two most important (as determined by the reporting agency taking into account their quantity, value, and deadliness) should be entered. Agencies should not enter  the 
quantity of the remaining drugs/narcotics coded as X = Over 3 Drug Types . Agencies should 
leave this data element blank. Because of problems in determining the street value of drugs or narcotics, agencies should not report a monetary value when they seize the drugs or na rcotics in connection with d rug/  
narcotic violations. However, in order to obtain some measure of the drug problem, agencies 
should report the Estimated Quantity of seized drugs or narcotics for each Drug/Narcotic Violation in these instances. LEAs should  not use this data element when they find drugs or narcotics, connected with other 
offenses , e.g., Arson, Burglary/ Breaking and E ntering, Larceny -Theft. E
xample 1  
 An
 agency seizes 1.5 kilograms of C rack , 2.125 pounds of M arijuana, 2.0 liquid ounces of 
Morphine, and 500 Valium capsules. The agency should enter 000000001500 for the C rack and 
000000002125 for the Marijuana into Data Element 21. The agency should not enter quantities 
for the Morphine or V alium. Version 1.0, 3/22/ 2018                                                         112  Example 2  
 
LE
 se
ized 15 marijuana plants from a greenhouse that was inside a residence. Police also seized 
5 pounds of Marijuana. The agency should enter 000000015000 for the plants and for the 
000000005000 for the Marijuana. (Remember the last three digits of the field represent the 
tenths, hundredths, and thousandths to the right of an implied decimal.) Example 3  
 A
n LEA
 seized a  bag of white powder  that they  suspected was  drugs. They sent the  powder to 
the laboratory for analysis. Therefore, the agency would enter 000000001000= None into D ata 
Element 21 . In addition, the agency must update the information once the analysis is  complete. Data Element 22 (Type Drug Measurement)  
 LEAs should use Data Element 22  to indicate the type of measurement used in quantifying 
drugs or narcotics seized in a drug case. Therefore, it should be used only if one of the offenses 
in an incident was 35A = Drug/Narcotic Violations, 6 = Seized was entered into Data Element 14 
(Type  Property Loss/Etc. ), and 10 = Drugs/Narcotics was entered into Data Element 15 
(Property Description). Data Element 22 (Type Drug Measurement) can contain up to three entries , and the data values 
should be consistent with the data values reported for Data Element 20 (Suspected Drug Type) . If more than three are involved, the types of measurement of the two most important drugs or narcotics (as determined by the reporting agency taking into account their quantity, value, and deadliness) should be entered. Do not enter the type of measurement for the remaining drugs 
or narcotics that  are coded as X = Over 3 Drug Types in Data Element 20 (Suspected Drug Type); 
leave this data element blank. If the substance was sent to a laboratory for analysis and a response has not yet been received, XX = Not Reported should be entered. In addition, 1 = None should be entered into Data 
Element 21 (Estimated Drug Quantity). When the agency receives the results of the laboratory 
analysis, the agency must update Data Elements 21 (Estimated Drug Quantity) and 22  (Type 
Drug Measurement) . LEAs should not use this data element when they find drugs or narcotics, connected with other 
offenses , e.g., Arson, Burglary/ Breaking and E ntering, Larceny/ Theft. Valid Data Values  
  LEAs can enter up to three  of the following  measurement types in Data Element 22 (Type Drug 
Measurement ): 
 
Weight  Capacity  Units  
GM = Gram  ML = Milliliter  DU = Dosage Units/Items1 
KG = Kilogram  LT = Liter  NP  = Number of Plants2 
V
ersion 1.0, 3/22/ 2018   113OZ = Ounce  FO = Fluid Ounce
