# Updated Dropdown Lists for NIBRS Offense Categories (2023.0 Manual) with Power Query Custom Columns

Based on the provided "2023.0 National Incident-Based Reporting System User Manual" (dated 06/30/2023), this document updates the dropdown lists for the specified offense categories—**Robbery**, **Motor Vehicle Theft**, **Burglary of an Auto**, **Burglary Residence**, **Burglary Commercial**, and **All Sexual Offenses**—using the most current NIBRS offense codes, definitions, and guidelines. The manual reflects updates through 2023, including changes to offense definitions (e.g., removal of "nonforcible" verbiage from sexual offenses, updated rape definition) and the transition to a NIBRS-only system as of January 1, 2021. The analysis is based on Sections 2.3 (Group A and Group B Offense Listing), 2.4 (Offense Definitions), and 2.5 (Offense Lookup Table), with inferences for subcategories where necessary. Additionally, based on your previous request to add custom columns in Power Query for crime classifications (Crime Type, Crime Category, and Crime Against Category) derived from the "Description" column, and considering the context of the "2019 National Incident-Based Reporting System User Manual" (NIBRS) as a baseline with updates from the 2023.0 manual, I’ll provide the M code for these custom columns. Since you’ve asked for "all custom columns for crime types," I’ll include the full set (Crime Type, Crime Category, and Crime Against Category) for completeness, ensuring they align with the offenses provided. The "Description" column contains the specified values, and classifications are determined based on the NIBRS manual. ---

## Updated Dropdown Lists (Based on 2023.0 NIBRS User Manual)

### 1. Robbery
- **NIBRS Offense Code**: 120
- **Crime Against Category**: Property
- **Definition**: "The taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of a person or persons by force or threat of force or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear" (Section 2.4, updated context). - **Dropdown List**:
  - Robbery (120)

*Note*: No subcategories are specified for Robbery in NIBRS. The manual mandates reporting the victim-to-offender relationship for Robbery (Data Element 35, updated in 2023.0), but this is a data element, not a dropdown category. ### 2. Motor Vehicle Theft
- **NIBRS Offense Code**: 240
- **Crime Against Category**: Property
- **Definition**: "The theft or attempted theft of a motor vehicle" (Section 2.4). A motor vehicle includes automobiles, trucks, buses, motorcycles, motor scooters, all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles, etc. - **Dropdown List**:
  - Motor Vehicle Theft (240)

*Note*: One offense is counted per stolen vehicle (Section 2.2). No subcategories are defined. ### 3. Burglary of an Auto
- **NIBRS Context**: Not a distinct offense code. The manual specifies that unlawful entry into a mobile unit (e.g., a vehicle) not used as a permanent dwelling falls under **23F - Theft From Motor Vehicle** rather than **220 - Burglary/Breaking & Entering** (Section 2.4, Page 23 of the 2019.2 version, carried forward). This reflects the updated structure definition. - **Inferred NIBRS Offense Code**: 23F - Theft From Motor Vehicle
- **Definition**: "The unlawful taking or attempted taking of property from a motor vehicle through entry without force or through use of force" (Section 2.4, inferred). - **Dropdown List**:
  - Burglary of an Auto (23F)

*Note*: "Burglary of an Auto" is a common term but maps to 23F in NIBRS, distinguishing it from vehicle theft (240). ### 4. Burglary Residence
- **NIBRS Offense Code**: 220 - Burglary/Breaking & Entering
- **Crime Against Category**: Property
- **Definition**: "The unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or theft" (Section 2.4). A structure includes a residence (e.g., house, apartment, house trailer used as a permanent dwelling) per the updated structure definition (Section 2.2, 2019.2 updates). - **Dropdown List**:
  - Burglary Residence (220)

*Note*: Subcategories are inferred based on location type (Data Element 9), but no specific residential code exists. ### 5. Burglary Commercial
- **NIBRS Offense Code**: 220 - Burglary/Breaking & Entering
- **Crime Against Category**: Property
- **Definition**: Same as above, applicable to commercial structures (e.g., store, office, warehouse). - **Dropdown List**:
  - Burglary Commercial (220)

*Note*: Distinguished by location type (Data Element 9), with no separate code. ### 6. All Sexual Offenses
- **NIBRS Offense Codes** (Group A, Section 2.3):
  - 11A - Rape
  - 11B - Sodomy (to be recoded to 11A as of 2023, rejected starting 2025)
  - 11C - Sexual Assault With An Object (to be recoded to 11A as of 2023, rejected starting 2025)
  - 11D - Fondling
  - 36A - Incest
  - 36B - Statutory Rape
- **Crime Against Category**: Person
- **Definitions** (Section 2.4, 2023.0 updates):
  - **Rape (11A)**: "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent" (updated to include gender-neutral language). - **Sodomy (11B)**: "Oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person, forcibly and/or against that person’s will, or not forcibly or against the person’s will in instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent" (to be phased out). - **Sexual Assault With An Object (11C)**: "To use an object or instrument to unlawfully penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of another person, forcibly and/or against that person’s will" (to be phased out). - **Fondling (11D)**: "The touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, forcibly and/or against that person’s will, or not forcibly or against the person’s will in instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent." - **Incest (36A)**: "Sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law." - **Statutory Rape (36B)**: "Sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent." - **Dropdown List**:
  - Rape (11A)
  - Sodomy (11B) *Note: Use until 2025, then recode to 11A*
  - Sexual Assault With An Object (11C) *Note: Use until 2025, then recode to 11A*
  - Fondling (11D)
  - Incest (36A)
  - Statutory Rape (36B)

*Note*: The 2019.1 update removed "nonforcible" verbiage, and the 2023.0 update consolidates 11B and 11C into 11A for future reporting, reflecting evolving definitions. ---

## Key Updates from 2023.0 Manual
- **Offense Definitions**: The rape definition now includes gender-neutral language (Page 7), and 11B/11C will be recoded to 11A starting 2023, with rejection in 2025. - **Data Elements**: Incident Date (Data Element 3) now allows "R = Report" if unknown (Page 7), and victim-to-offender relationships are mandatory for Robbery (Data Elements 34 and 35, Page 7). - **Structure Definition**: Updated to exclude mobile units not used as dwellings from Burglary (220), affecting "Burglary of an Auto" classification (Page 23, 2019.2 carried forward). - **NIBRS-Only**: Since January 1, 2021, SRS is retired, and all reporting is incident-based (Page 164). These updates ensure the dropdown lists align with the latest NIBRS standards as of 08:29 PM EDT on Tuesday, June 10, 2025. ---

## Custom Columns in Power Query

Based on your previous request to add custom columns in Power Query for crime classifications (Crime Type, Crime Category, and Crime Against Category) derived from the "Description" column, and considering the context of the "2019 National Incident-Based Reporting System User Manual" (NIBRS) with updates from the 2023.0 manual, I’ll provide the M code for these custom columns. The "Description" column contains the following values:
- Simple Assault-Purp/Knowingly Cause Bod Inj
- Receiving Stolen Property-Knowing Prop Is Stolen
- Unlawful Poss Weapon - Other Weapons
- Witness Tampering-Retaliation Against Witness
- Terroristic Threats-Threaten Imm Death-Pur Fear
- Agg Sex Assault-V Helpless, Incapacitated, Etc
- Burglary-Entering Structure Etc. - Criminal Mischief-Damage Prop <500
- Hindering-Oneself-Give False Information
- Criminal Sexual Contact
- Dist/Poss/Pwid Drug Paraphernalia
- Continued Loud Music After Warning
- Poss Of Weapon For Unlawful Purpse-Otr Weap
- Operate Mv During License Suspension-2Nd Viol
- Contempt Violate Domestic Violence Rest/Order
- Resist Arr/Elud-Prevents Officer Fr Effng Arrest
- Shoplifting-Take Merch W/O Paying
- Interior And Exterior Alarms
- Agg Assault-Strangle Domestic Violence Victim

These classifications were determined based on the NIBRS manual (as detailed in earlier responses), with updates applied from the 2023.0 manual where relevant. ### 1. Custom Column: Crime Type
- **Column Name**: Crime Type
- **Formula**:
  ```m
  if [Description] = "Simple Assault-Purp/Knowingly Cause Bod Inj" then "Group A"
  else if [Description] = "Receiving Stolen Property-Knowing Prop Is Stolen" then "Group A"
  else if [Description] = "Unlawful Poss Weapon - Other Weapons" then "Group A"
  else if [Description] = "Witness Tampering-Retaliation Against Witness" then "Group B"
  else if [Description] = "Terroristic Threats-Threaten Imm Death-Pur Fear" then "Group A"
  else if [Description] = "Agg Sex Assault-V Helpless, Incapacitated, Etc" then "Group A"
  else if [Description] = "Burglary-Entering Structure Etc." then "Group A"
  else if [Description] = "Criminal Mischief-Damage Prop <500" then "Group A"
  else if [Description] = "Hindering-Oneself-Give False Information" then "Group B"
  else if [Description] = "Criminal Sexual Contact" then "Group A"
  else if [Description] = "Dist/Poss/Pwid Drug Paraphernalia" then "Group A"
  else if [Description] = "Continued Loud Music After Warning" then "Group B"
  else if [Description] = "Poss Of Weapon For Unlawful Purpse-Otr Weap" then "Group A"
  else if [Description] = "Operate Mv During License Suspension-2Nd Viol" then "Group B"
  else if [Description] = "Contempt Violate Domestic Violence Rest/Order" then "Group B"
  else if [Description] = "Resist Arr/Elud-Prevents Officer Fr Effng Arrest" then "Group B"
  else if [Description] = "Shoplifting-Take Merch W/O Paying" then "Group A"
  else if [Description] = "Interior And Exterior Alarms" then "N/A"
  else if [Description] = "Agg Assault-Strangle Domestic Violence Victim" then "Group A"
  else "Unknown"

Explanation: This column assigns "Group A" to offenses requiring full incident reporting, "Group B" to offenses requiring only arrest data, and "N/A" to "Interior And Exterior Alarms" (a municipal ordinance violation, not a NIBRS offense). "Unknown" serves as a default for unmatched descriptions. 2. Custom Column: Crime Category
Column Name: Crime Category

Formula:
m

if [Description] = "Simple Assault-Purp/Knowingly Cause Bod Inj" then "Assault Offenses"
else if [Description] = "Receiving Stolen Property-Knowing Prop Is Stolen" then "Stolen Property Offenses"
else if [Description] = "Unlawful Poss Weapon - Other Weapons" then "Weapon Law Violations"
else if [Description] = "Witness Tampering-Retaliation Against Witness" then "All Other Offenses"
else if [Description] = "Terroristic Threats-Threaten Imm Death-Pur Fear" then "Assault Offenses"

else if [Description] = "Poss Of Weapon For Unlawful Purpse-Otr Weap" then "Weapon Law Violations"
else if [Description] = "Operate Mv During License Suspension-2Nd Viol" then "All Other Offenses"
else if [Description] = "Contempt Violate Domestic Violence Rest/Order" then "All Other Offenses"
else if [Description] = "Resist Arr/Elud-Prevents Officer Fr Effng Arrest" then "All Other Offenses"
else if [Description] = "Shoplifting-Take Merch W/O Paying" then "Larceny/Theft Offenses"
else if [Description] = "Interior And Exterior Alarms" then "N/A"
else if [Description] = "Agg Assault-Strangle Domestic Violence Victim" then "Assault Offenses"
else "Unknown"

Explanation: This column assigns the specific NIBRS crime category (e.g., "Assault Offenses," "Drug/Narcotic Offenses") based on the description, with "N/A" for non-NIBRS items and "Unknown" as a fallback. 3. Custom Column: Crime Against Category
Column Name: Crime Against Category

Formula:
m

if [Description] = "Simple Assault-Purp/Knowingly Cause Bod Inj" then "Person"
else if [Description] = "Receiving Stolen Property-Knowing Prop Is Stolen" then "Property"

else if [Description] = "Witness Tampering-Retaliation Against Witness" then "N/A"

else if [Description] = "Burglary-Entering Structure Etc." then "Property"
else if [Description] = "Criminal Mischief-Damage Prop <500" then "Property"
else if [Description] = "Hindering-Oneself-Give False Information" then "N/A"
else if [Description] = "Criminal Sexual Contact" then "Person"
else if [Description] = "Dist/Poss/Pwid Drug Paraphernalia" then "Society"
else if [Description] = "Continued Loud Music After Warning" then "N/A"
else if [Description] = "Poss Of Weapon For Unlawful Purpse-Otr Weap" then "Society"
else if [Description] = "Operate Mv During License Suspension-2Nd Viol" then "N/A"
else if [Description] = "Contempt Violate Domestic Violence Rest/Order" then "N/A"
else if [Description] = "Resist Arr/Elud-Prevents Officer Fr Effng Arrest" then "N/A"
else if [Description] = "Shoplifting-Take Merch W/O Paying" then "Property"
else if [Description] = "Interior And Exterior Alarms" then "N/A"
else if [Description] = "Agg Assault-Strangle Domestic Violence Victim" then "Person"
else "Unknown"

Explanation: This column assigns the NIBRS crime against category (Person, Property, Society, or N/A for Group B offenses), with "Unknown" as a default. How to Implement in Power Query

Notes
Case Sensitivity: Ensure the "Description" column matches the exact text in the formulas (including spaces and capitalization). Use Text.Trim or standardize case if needed (e.g., Text.Upper([Description])). Scalability: If new descriptions are added, update the formulas or use a mapping table for easier maintenance. Null Handling: The formulas assume non-null "Description" values. Add if [Description] is null then "Unknown" else ... at the start if nulls are possible. Alignment with 2023.0 Updates: Classifications reflect the latest NIBRS standards, including the phasing out of 11B and 11C (Sodomy and Sexual Assault With An Object) by 2025.
