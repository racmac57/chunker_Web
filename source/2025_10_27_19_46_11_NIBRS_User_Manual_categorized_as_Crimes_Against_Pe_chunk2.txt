Notes
Mandatory vs. Conditional vs. Optional Data Elements: Mandatory elements must always be reported for valid data submission. Conditional elements depend on specific circumstances (e.g., property recovery, law enforcement officer victim). Optional elements can be reported at the agency’s discretion. Dropdown Menus: The numbered lists for each data element’s sub-elements are designed to be directly translatable into dropdown menus for standardized Hawkins data entry systems, ensuring standardized data collection. Arrest Data for Group B Offenses: Only arrest data are collected for Group B offenses, using Data Elements 40–52, as detailed above. Date Format: All date fields (e.g., Incident Date, Exceptional Clearance Date, Date Recovered, Arrest Date) must be in YYYYMMDD format. Numeric Fields: Fields like Number of Premises Entered, Number of Stolen/Recovered Motor Vehicles, Value of Property, and Estimated Drug Quantity require numeric inputs (whole numbers or decimals as specified). Mutually Exclusive and Lesser Included Offenses: Ensure offenses reported are not mutually exclusive (e.g., Murder and Aggravated Assault cannot occur to the same victim) or lesser included (e.g., assault as part of Robbery is not reported separately). This outline provides a complete and structured reference for all NIBRS crimes, their elements, and sub-elements, suitable for implementation in a data entry system with dropdown menus. If further clarification or additional details are needed, please specify.
